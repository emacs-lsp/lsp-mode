Here are the most important features/news in 7.0 release lsp-mode/the team/the ecosystem # lsp-mode team and the activity in the repo has vastly increased. lsp-mode is no longer one man project but it is a product of Emacs LSP team and emacs community. This has allowed us to implement some very time consuming changes/refactoring(more about them bellow) which an year ago were unthinkable due to the lack manpower. emacs-lsp repo has become a nice place to start contributing to open source or learn elisp and now there are 244 contributors in the main repo. Even more some of the current maintainers had zero elisp knowledge before doing their first lsp-mode contributions. We started moving out some of the server specific packages(e. g. lsp-dart maintained by ericdallo and lsp-metals maintained by kurnevsky , lsp-python-ms by seagle0128 , etc) in order to provide focused support by a an expert in the language at hand. Considering where we were few months ago the level of integrated experience provided by those packages has increased and often it is comparable with backed by paid full time developers editors like VScode . Here it is a gif illustrating that: lsp-dart . LSP in its nature should be language agnostic but in order to be comparable with VScode lsp-mode should support language server extensions as well which is much more work than the work on protocol itself and requires a constant monitoring of the server repo since there is no contract and the server team might change the contract whenever they want. On the bright side lsp-mode has attracted several server side developers or lsp-mode team members(e. g. mpanarin ) has become server side contributors and often we are ahead of changes or we directly address issues in the server when they arise. We are still looking for maintainer(s) for JS/TS suite( typescript-language-server , eslint , angular ) though. Major features # 3.16 spec support # We provided full support for 3.14 features one year after the version has been released. Now, we have support for all major features of 3.16 protocol even before it has been released (except for result streaming which apparently hasn't been implemented by any language server). New website # It is created ericdallo - here it is the website . Check it out and eventually provide feedback. Semantic highlights # This is part of 3.16 spec. It is implemented by sebastiansturm and it can be enabled by setting lsp-enable-semantic-highlighting . We have dropped the Theia protocol support for semantic highlighting since it is not going to make to the official spec. ATM it is supported by Rust Analyzer , Clangd (from master branch) and lua language server. org-mode integration(preview) # org-mode mode is the Emacs flagman and this integration brings up the literate programming to a new level. The integration is pretty raw but usable - you basically can run lsp-mode language intelligence over org-mode source block directly in the org-mode document. We have achieved that by creating virtual buffer abstraction which allows us to fake the server that the client has actually opened the real file. Check gif and the docs . I think that the ability to implement such features is why Emacs is editor in a league of its own . And implementing such features is one of the signs that we are slowly moving from the phase catching up into getting ahead (or maybe I am overly optimistic). Language Server Protocol bindings, upcoming changes # We generated json schema from the protocol and from that schema we generated dash destructoring, getters, setters, validators, constructors, indication for optional/required fields, etc. which allow us to perform compile time validation of the protocol usage. This was huge change because we had to walk through almost all methods and replace explicit access to the elisp data structure with protocol usage. At the same time, emacs-lsp organization has more than 20k lines of code. This was coordinated effort and a lot of individuals contributed to that. The benefits are that we now can switch the underlying data structure from hashmap to plists which will yield better performance and also that the overall quality of the codebase has increased. Example Before: ( defun lsp--position-to-point ( params ) \"Convert Position object in PARAMS to a point.\" ( lsp--line-character-to-point ( gethash \"line\" params ) ( gethash \"character\" params ))) After: ( lsp-defun lsp--position-to-point (( &Position :line :character )) \"Convert `Position' object in PARAMS to a point.\" ( lsp--line-character-to-point line character )) In this example :line and :character are validated as fields of Position structure. Also, we do some handy conversions, if the field is optional it will end up with ? like :foo? . To reduce boiler plate code we convert camelCase to :camel-case when we are destructoring it. Performance optimizations(flycheck, code completion) # We have rewritten the flycheck integration - the new integration provides the same UE as the old one but it is much more effective in reporting the errors to flycheck and lsp checker is much closer to the traditional flycheck checkers which are initiated/controlled from Emacs . Completion integration code is now much simpler/faster thanks to kiennq . What's next # Upcoming breaking changes Dropping Emacs 25 support. This will allow us utilize Emacs multi-threading to improve lsp-mode responsibility Switching from hashtables to plists - once this change goes in users must recompile all lsp-mode extensions. Drop company-lsp support(not ported to use lsp-protocol.el ) Implementing lsp-mode configuration wizard to improve beginners experience - check this issue for more details. The overall goal is let user pick settings for all features that are opinionated (e. g. lsp-ui ) and improve the discoverability of lsp-mode features/extensions/settings. We will try to switch to monthly/weakly release cycles and to different person for writing the announcements. We might eventually encourage melpa-stable usage.","title":"7.0 Release"},{"location":"blog/2020/7.0-release/#70-release","text":"I am pleased to announce lsp-mode 7.0!

Release 6.1 # Support for new languages/language servers: # Kotlin Language Server (Thanks to Jon Carr) gopls Language Server for Go XML Language Server (lsp4xml) Hack (using HHVM ) Intelephense for PHP clojure-lsp for Clojure/ClojureScipt (Thanks to Dario Benedek Fazekas) elmLS for Elm (Thanks to Daniel-V) FsAutoComplete for F# (Thanks to Reed Mullanix) Added Erlang support via erlang ls Added Dockerfile support via dockerfile-language-server-nodejs New logging options # lsp-mode now logs to buffer *lsp-log* , instead of *Messages* . This can be controlled with the variable lsp-log-max (Thanks to Thomas Fini Hansen). If lsp-print-performance is non-nil, lsp-mode will log a corresponding performance trace to *lsp-log* for every message to and from the server. The variable lsp-print-io , when non-nil will cause lsp-mode to log all messages to and from the server to a unique *lsp-io* buffer for every project root. These logs can be saved to a file and viewed using the LSP Inspector . LSP Methods # Add support for textDocument/prepareRename . If supported by the language server, all renaming operations will be tested for validity. Add support for file watches . Add support for CodeAction literals . Add API level support for folding ranges . Folding support for origami.el support is implemented by package lsp-origami . Support document links . This can be controlled using the variable lsp-enable-links . Support resource operations (edits sent from the language server can now create/modify/remove files and directories). Add support for workspace/configuration . Add new function lsp-disconnect . Added lsp-find-definition-mouse and bound to C-<down-mouse-1> Added lsp-extend-selection as a frontend of new LSP method textDocument/extendSelection Other changes # Add project logo (thanks to Jon Carr). Created an integration test suite for lsp-mode (See directory features ). If available, using the native JSON API introduced in Emacs 27.1. Tramp implementation now uses TRAMP process instead of TCP sockets (Thanks to Karsten Patzwaldt). LSP autoconfiguration adds company-lsp to the list of company backends instead of overriding it. Add lsp-mode-map . Add menu bar entries for lsp-mode . Perform before save operations ( textDocument/willSaveWaitUntil ) asynchronously. imenu support is now handled asynchronously (Thanks to Dario Gjorgjevski). Added option :none for lsp-prefer-flymake , which disabled both Flymake and Flycheck support. Changed flymake to report the errors immediately after they arrive instead of waiting flymake to call lsp-mode . Add debounce when server does not support incremental updates. Add hook lsp-after-uninitialized-hook , which stores the list of functions called after a language server has been uninitialized. Add variable lsp-symbol-highlighting-skip-current , which lets the user skip the current symbol when a given symbol is being highlighted. Add variable lsp-enabled-clients , which lets users set which defined clients are allowed to be used. Support multiple signatures while displaying eldoc text. Add variable lsp-signature-render-all , which when non-nil forces lsp-mode to only show the current active signature. Expose configuration settings for various language servers. Language servers can now be disabled with the variable lsp-disabled-clients . Improved applying changes speed. Fixed xref support for emacs 27+ Implemented automatic installation for F# language server. Added Emacs 26.x to CI Fixed handling of stderr when running over TRAMP . Implemented support for running the language server in Docker container over local files. Release 6.0 # lsp-mode now have single entry point lsp for all language and based on the major mode starts the corresponding language servers. Added flymake integration. lsp automatically enables and configures company-lsp , lsp-ui , yasnippet , or flymake if they are present so no additional configuration is needed except installing the packages. That behavior could be disabled by setting lsp-auto-configure to nil . lsp-mode ships with several predefined servers located in lsp-clients.el which does not require additional package. For the more complex Language Servers like Eclipse JDT , ccls , cquery and haskell we still require separate package due to relatively high code base. lsp-mode handles automatically server failures by asking the user whether he/she wants to restart the server. introduced new command lsp-describe-session which replaces the existing one lsp-capabilities . The command lists the folders that are part of the workspace and the servers that are associated with the corresponding folder. lsp-mode displays information about the running server and it's status in the modeline. lsp-define-stdio-client and lsp-define-tcp-client are replaced with lsp-register-client lsp rely on projectile or project.el now only for suggesting project root. Once you open new file in a project and start lsp it will provide several options(import project, blacklist project, select other directory root). Once you select a root it will be persisted and used for the next sessions. support for multiple language servers per single file and workspace. changed lsp-mode settings to more sensible defaults. Removed all synchronous calls from the server startup.

If you get this try to run the exact command that lsp-mode is running in the terminal. You may find it in *lsp-log* buffer. How to configure a server with local variables? Add lsp server call to hack-local-variables-hook which runs right after the local variables are loaded. ( add-hook 'hack-local-variables-hook ( lambda () ( when ( derived-mode-p 'XXX-mode ) ( lsp )))) I have multiple language servers registered for language FOO. Which one will be used when opening a project? The one with highest priority wins. lsp-clients.el predefined servers have priority -1, lower than external packages (priority 0 if unspecified). If a server is registered with :add-on? flag set to t it will be started in parallel to the other servers that are registered for the current mode. I have multiple language servers for language FOO and I want to select the server per project, what can I do? You may create dir-local for each of the projects and specify list of lsp-enabled-clients . This will narrow the list of the clients that are going to be tested for the project. The completion does not work fine and inserts arguments and placeholders, what I am doing wrong? make sure you have installed yasnippet and you have yasnippet minor mode enabled. I am getting \"Package \u2018spinner-1.7.3\u2019 is unavailable\" when trying to install lsp-mode . This is caused by GPG keys used by the ELPA package manager not being up to date. You may fix by installing: gnu-elpa-keyring-update The flycheck does not work in typescript , html and javascript blocks in vue-mode . How to fix that? This is caused by the fact that vue-mode uses multiple major modes in single file and the lsp-ui checker may not associated with the major mode at point.

If you get this try to run the exact command that lsp-mode is running in the terminal. You may find it in *lsp-log* buffer. How to configure a server with local variables?

( add-hook 'hack-local-variables-hook ( lambda () ( when ( derived-mode-p 'XXX-mode ) ( lsp )))) I have multiple language servers registered for language FOO. Which one will be used when opening a project? The one with highest priority wins. lsp-clients.el predefined servers have priority -1, lower than external packages (priority 0 if unspecified). If a server is registered with :add-on? flag set to t it will be started in parallel to the other servers that are registered for the current mode. I have multiple language servers for language FOO and I want to select the server per project, what can I do? You may create dir-local for each of the projects and specify list of lsp-enabled-clients . This will narrow the list of the clients that are going to be tested for the project. The completion does not work fine and inserts arguments and placeholders, what I am doing wrong? make sure you have installed yasnippet and you have yasnippet minor mode enabled. I am getting \"Package \u2018spinner-1.7.3\u2019 is unavailable\" when trying to install lsp-mode . This is caused by GPG keys used by the ELPA package manager not being up to date. You may fix by installing: gnu-elpa-keyring-update The flycheck does not work in typescript , html and javascript blocks in vue-mode . How to fix that? This is caused by the fact that vue-mode uses multiple major modes in single file and the lsp-ui checker may not associated with the major mode at point.

Why should I try LSP for Clojure? # Coming from the Java world, when I started programming for Clojure in Emacs, it was odd to me that for almost everything you needed to do with Clojure, you needed a REPL running in your project , and if you changed anything in your project, you would need to reload the modified namespace/code to see the changes in the REPL. I also missed a lot of features popularized by Java IDEs, like cleaning unused imports, viewing the call hierarchy of a method/function, formatting code automatically, checking syntax in real-time, and using code actions that could, for example, add a missing import. Ever since I found clojure-lsp , which implements most of those features, I have been using it alongside CIDER without issues. While I really like CIDER and believe it is one of the best tools for Clojure development, you can complement it with clojure-lsp to make programming in Clojure even better. Once it is running (and you are plugged into the REPL), CIDER will provide many of the same features that clojure-lsp does, so you need to tell Emacs how to resolve conflicts. Therefore, if you want to have a more IDE-ish experience with Emacs, you should read this guide. Basic configuration # Here is a bare-bones lsp-mode configuration template to get you started with your own lsp-mode config, or to try out in a separate one-off session.

Installing the language server # lsp-mode is a client-server application with Emacs acting as the client.

Via lsp-mode # lsp-mode ships with automatic installation scripts for some of the language servers and clojure-lsp is one of the supported servers, you can install it using M-x lsp-install-server RET clojure-lsp .

Syntax check # It checks for errors and warnings on your code while you write it, it uses clj-kondo , another amazing library that lints Clojure code, in the back-end so it's not required to install clj-kondo since clojure-lsp will use it automatically. It will also check for public unused functions/variables which is something that, as far as I know, does not exist in any other Clojure library/package: Find definition/references # You can find a function definition with lsp-find-definition or find all the references to that symbol, variable or function with lsp-find-references or lsp-ui-peek-find-references if lsp-ui is available.

When present, company-mode and enabled for lsp-mode , it will be auto-configured and it will just work using the completion items returned by the LSP server. If you do not want LSP completion, It's possible to use cider completion instead with: ( setq lsp-enable-completion-at-point nil ) ; use cider completion See also CIDER code completion Code lens # LSP supports code lenses, actionable text snippets that a server may want to display in a client IDE. clojure-lsp uses it to show the reference count of a function/variable. They are disabled by default so you need to manually enable them via: ( setq lsp-lens-enable t ) Call hierarchy # This feature returns the call hierarchy of a function/method. As of now, clojure-lsp only supports returning the incoming-call hierarchy. It uses lsp-treemacs , which you should install to use this feature. Formatting # For LSP formatting, clojure-lsp use cljfmt with support for all known cljfmt settings. You can format a region with lsp-format-region or the entire buffer with lsp-format-buffer . Code actions # One of the most important features considered by me is the code actions feature provided by the server. they are refactoring actions that may change your code after applied, clojure-lsp some of the refactorings from below are suggested by the server depending where user cursor is, for example Add missing namespace where clojure-lsp will suggest adding a missing require: Refactorings # clojure-lsp also has a lot of refactorings, some of them can be automatically triggered by code actions like said above and others manually by user, one example of one of the most used by me is clean-ns , which will remove any unused requires and refers: Or rename which will rename the symbol at point and all usages/references: For more info on all available refactorings, check here . Conflict with clj-refactor when creating new files clj-refactor and clojure-lsp have a feature of add the namespace form for new created files, but they may conflict if both are enable, inserting duplicated namespace forms.

I also missed a lot of features popularized by Java IDEs, like cleaning unused imports, viewing the call hierarchy of a method/function, formatting code automatically, checking syntax in real-time, and using code actions that could, for example, add a missing import. Ever since I found clojure-lsp , which implements most of those features, I have been using it alongside CIDER without issues. While I really like CIDER and believe it is one of the best tools for Clojure development, you can complement it with clojure-lsp to make programming in Clojure even better. Once it is running (and you are plugged into the REPL), CIDER will provide many of the same features that clojure-lsp does, so you need to tell Emacs how to resolve conflicts.

To use the generator as well as to run the React application server, you'll need the Node.js JavaScript runtime and npm (Node.js package manager) installed. npm is included with Node.js, which you can download and install from Node.js downloads . Tip : To test that you have Node.js and npm correctly installed on your machine, you can type node --version and npm --version in a terminal or command prompt. You can now create a new React application by typing: npx create-react-app my-app where my-app is the name of the folder for your React application. It may take a few minutes to create it and to install its dependencies. Note : If you've previously installed create-react-app globally via npm install -g create-react-app , we recommend you uninstall the package using npm uninstall -g create-react-app to ensure that npx always uses the latest version. Let's quickly run our React application by navigating to the new folder and typing npm start to start the web server and to open the application in a browser: cd my-app npm start Note: in order to avoid this issue , you have to add a jsconfig.json in the top of the folder: { \"compilerOptions\" : { \"module\" : \"commonjs\" , \"target\" : \"es2016\" , \"jsx\" : \"preserve\" , \"allowJs\" : true , \"allowSyntheticDefaultImports\" : true , \"allowNonTsExtensions\" : true } } You should see the React logo and a link to \"Learn React\" on http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Installing the typescript language server # Emacs supports automatic language server installation, so the first time you run M-x lsp in a JavaScript file opened in it, you will be prompted for a language server to install. Select ts-ls . Importing the project # Then you have to select project root. Press i . Syntax highlighting and bracket matching # You'll notice that Emacs has syntax highlighting for the various source code elements and, if you put the cursor on a parenthesis, the matching bracket is also selected. IntelliSense # As you start typing in index.js , you'll see smart suggestions or completions. After you select a suggestion and type . , you see the types and methods on the object through IntelliSense . Emacs uses the TypeScript language service for its JavaScript code intelligence and it has a feature called Automatic Type Acquisition (ATA). ATA pulls down the npm Type Declaration files ( *.d.ts ) for the npm modules referenced in the package.json . If you select a method, you'll also get parameter help: Go to Definition, Peek definition # Through the TypeScript language service, Emacs can also provide type definition information in the editor through Go to Definition ( M-. ) or Peek Definition ( M-x lsp-ui-peek-find-definitions ). Put the cursor over the App , right click and select Go to definition . Note : Peek definition requires installing lsp-ui package which is not part of the default installation. Hello World! # Let's update the sample application to \"Hello World!\". Add the link to declare a new H1 header and replace the <App /> tag in ReactDOM.render with element . import React from 'react' ; import ReactDOM from 'react-dom' ; import './index.css' ; import App from './App' ; import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals' ; var element = React . createElement ( 'h1' , { className : 'greeting' }, 'Hello, world!' ); ReactDOM . render ( element , document . getElementById ( 'root' )); reportWebVitals (); Once you save the index.js file, the running instance of the server will update the web page and you'll see \"Hello World!\". Debugging React # To debug the client side React code, we'll need to install the Debugger for Chrome extension. Note: This tutorial assumes you have the Chrome browser installed. There are also debugger extensions for the Edge and Firefox browsers. Press M-x and type dap-chrome-setup . Set a breakpoint # To set a breakpoint in index.js , click on the gutter to the left of the line numbers. This will set a breakpoint which will be visible as a red circle. Configure the Chrome debugger # We need to initially configure the debugger . To do so, create a launch.json file in the .vscode/ subfolder of the project root with a configuration to launch the website: { \"version\" : \"0.2.0\" , \"configurations\" : [ { \"type\" : \"chrome\" , \"request\" : \"launch\" , \"name\" : \"Launch Chrome against localhost\" , \"url\" : \"http://localhost:3000\" , \"webRoot\" : \"${workspaceFolder}\" } ] } Ensure that your development server is running ( npm start ). Then type M-x dap-debug or use Debug -> Start menu. The source code where the breakpoint is set runs on startup before the debugger was attached, so we won't hit the breakpoint until we refresh the web page. Refresh the page and you should hit your breakpoint. You can step through your source code using M-x dap-next , inspect variables such as element , and see the call stack of the client side React application. The Debugger for Chrome extension README has lots of information on other configurations, working with sourcemaps, and troubleshooting. You can review it their README Live editing and debugging # If you are using webpack together with your React app, you can have a more efficient workflow by taking advantage of webpack's HMR mechanism which enables you to have live editing and debugging directly from Emacs. You can learn more in this Live edit and debug your React apps directly from Emacs(TO BE PORTED TO EMACS) blog post and the webpack Hot Module Replacement documentation(TO BE PORTED TO EMACS) . Linting # Linters analyze your source code and can warn about potential problems before running your application. The JavaScript language service included with Emacs has syntax error checking support by default, which you can see in action in the Errors List panel ( M-x lsp-treemacs-errors-list ). Try making a small error in your React source code and you'll see a red squiggle and an error in the Errors List panel. Linters can provide more sophisticated analysis, enforcing coding conventions and detecting anti-patterns. A popular JavaScript linter is ESLint . ESLint, when combined with the ESLint Emacs extension , provides a great in-product linting experience. First, install the ESLint command-line tool: npm install -g eslint Then install the ESLint language server by doing M-x lsp-install-server RET eslint RET . Once the ESLint extension is installed, you'll want to create an ESLint configuration file, .eslintrc.js . You can create one using M-x lsp-eslint-create-default-configuration . The command will prompt you to answer a series of questions in a separate window. Accept the defaults, and it will create a .eslintrc.js file in your project root that looks something like this: module . exports = { \"env\" : { \"browser\" : true , \"es2020\" : true }, \"extends\" : [ \"eslint:recommended\" , \"plugin:react/recommended\" ], \"parserOptions\" : { \"ecmaFeatures\" : { \"jsx\" : true }, \"ecmaVersion\" : 11 , \"sourceType\" : \"module\" }, \"plugins\" : [ \"react\" ], \"rules\" : { } }; ESLint will now analyze open files and shows a warning in index.js about 'App' being defined but never used. You can modify the ESLint rules in the .eslintrc.js file. Let's add an error rule for extra semi-colons: \"rules\" : { \"no-extra-semi\" : \"error\" } Now when you mistakenly have multiple semicolons on a line, you'll see an error (red squiggle) in the editor and error entry in the Problems panel. Popular Starter Kits # In this tutorial, we used the create-react-app generator to create a simple React application. There are lots of great samples and starter kits available to help build your first React application.

The JavaScript language service included with Emacs has syntax error checking support by default, which you can see in action in the Errors List panel ( M-x lsp-treemacs-errors-list ). Try making a small error in your React source code and you'll see a red squiggle and an error in the Errors List panel. Linters can provide more sophisticated analysis, enforcing coding conventions and detecting anti-patterns. A popular JavaScript linter is ESLint . ESLint, when combined with the ESLint Emacs extension , provides a great in-product linting experience. First, install the ESLint command-line tool: npm install -g eslint Then install the ESLint language server by doing M-x lsp-install-server RET eslint RET . Once the ESLint extension is installed, you'll want to create an ESLint configuration file, .eslintrc.js . You can create one using M-x lsp-eslint-create-default-configuration . The command will prompt you to answer a series of questions in a separate window. Accept the defaults, and it will create a .eslintrc.js file in your project root that looks something like this: module . exports = { \"env\" : { \"browser\" : true , \"es2020\" : true }, \"extends\" : [ \"eslint:recommended\" , \"plugin:react/recommended\" ], \"parserOptions\" : { \"ecmaFeatures\" : { \"jsx\" : true }, \"ecmaVersion\" : 11 , \"sourceType\" : \"module\" }, \"plugins\" : [ \"react\" ], \"rules\" : { } }; ESLint will now analyze open files and shows a warning in index.js about 'App' being defined but never used. You can modify the ESLint rules in the .eslintrc.js file. Let's add an error rule for extra semi-colons: \"rules\" : { \"no-extra-semi\" : \"error\" } Now when you mistakenly have multiple semicolons on a line, you'll see an error (red squiggle) in the editor and error entry in the Problems panel.","title":"Linting"},{"location":"tutorials/reactjs-tutorial/#popular-starter-kits","text":"In this tutorial, we used the create-react-app generator to create a simple React application.
