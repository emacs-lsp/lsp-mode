Here are the most important features/news in 7.0 release lsp-mode/the team/the ecosystem # lsp-mode team and the activity in the repo has vastly increased. lsp-mode is no longer one man project but it is a product of Emacs LSP team and emacs community. This has allowed us to implement some very time consuming changes/refactoring(more about them bellow) which an year ago were unthinkable due to the lack manpower. emacs-lsp repo has become a nice place to start contributing to open source or learn elisp and now there are 244 contributors in the main repo. Even more some of the current maintainers had zero elisp knowledge before doing their first lsp-mode contributions. We started moving out some of the server specific packages(e. g. lsp-dart maintained by ericdallo and lsp-metals maintained by kurnevsky , lsp-python-ms by seagle0128 , etc) in order to provide focused support by a an expert in the language at hand. Considering where we were few months ago the level of integrated experience provided by those packages has increased and often it is comparable with backed by paid full time developers editors like VScode . Here it is a gif illustrating that: lsp-dart . LSP in its nature should be language agnostic but in order to be comparable with VScode lsp-mode should support language server extensions as well which is much more work than the work on protocol itself and requires a constant monitoring of the server repo since there is no contract and the server team might change the contract whenever they want. On the bright side lsp-mode has attracted several server side developers or lsp-mode team members(e. g. mpanarin ) has become server side contributors and often we are ahead of changes or we directly address issues in the server when they arise. We are still looking for maintainer(s) for JS/TS suite( typescript-language-server , eslint , angular ) though. Major features # 3.16 spec support # We provided full support for 3.14 features one year after the version has been released. Now, we have support for all major features of 3.16 protocol even before it has been released (except for result streaming which apparently hasn't been implemented by any language server). New website # It is created ericdallo - here it is the website . Check it out and eventually provide feedback. Semantic highlights # This is part of 3.16 spec. It is implemented by sebastiansturm and it can be enabled by setting lsp-enable-semantic-highlighting . We have dropped the Theia protocol support for semantic highlighting since it is not going to make to the official spec. ATM it is supported by Rust Analyzer , Clangd (from master branch) and lua language server. org-mode integration(preview) # org-mode mode is the Emacs flagman and this integration brings up the literate programming to a new level. The integration is pretty raw but usable - you basically can run lsp-mode language intelligence over org-mode source block directly in the org-mode document. We have achieved that by creating virtual buffer abstraction which allows us to fake the server that the client has actually opened the real file. Check gif and the docs . I think that the ability to implement such features is why Emacs is editor in a league of its own . And implementing such features is one of the signs that we are slowly moving from the phase catching up into getting ahead (or maybe I am overly optimistic). Language Server Protocol bindings, upcoming changes # We generated json schema from the protocol and from that schema we generated dash destructoring, getters, setters, validators, constructors, indication for optional/required fields, etc. which allow us to perform compile time validation of the protocol usage. This was huge change because we had to walk through almost all methods and replace explicit access to the elisp data structure with protocol usage. At the same time, emacs-lsp organization has more than 20k lines of code. This was coordinated effort and a lot of individuals contributed to that. The benefits are that we now can switch the underlying data structure from hashmap to plists which will yield better performance and also that the overall quality of the codebase has increased. Example Before: ( defun lsp--position-to-point ( params ) \"Convert Position object in PARAMS to a point.\" ( lsp--line-character-to-point ( gethash \"line\" params ) ( gethash \"character\" params ))) After: ( lsp-defun lsp--position-to-point (( &Position :line :character )) \"Convert `Position' object in PARAMS to a point.\" ( lsp--line-character-to-point line character )) In this example :line and :character are validated as fields of Position structure. Also, we do some handy conversions, if the field is optional it will end up with ? like :foo? . To reduce boiler plate code we convert camelCase to :camel-case when we are destructoring it. Performance optimizations(flycheck, code completion) # We have rewritten the flycheck integration - the new integration provides the same UE as the old one but it is much more effective in reporting the errors to flycheck and lsp checker is much closer to the traditional flycheck checkers which are initiated/controlled from Emacs . Completion integration code is now much simpler/faster thanks to kiennq . What's next # Upcoming breaking changes Dropping Emacs 25 support. This will allow us utilize Emacs multi-threading to improve lsp-mode responsibility Switching from hashtables to plists - once this change goes in users must recompile all lsp-mode extensions. Drop company-lsp support(not ported to use lsp-protocol.el ) Implementing lsp-mode configuration wizard to improve beginners experience - check this issue for more details. The overall goal is let user pick settings for all features that are opinionated (e. g. lsp-ui ) and improve the discoverability of lsp-mode features/extensions/settings. We will try to switch to monthly/weakly release cycles and to different person for writing the announcements.

Add support for Crystal via scry (#1218). Implement textDocument/documentColor support. Release 6.1 # Support for new languages/language servers: # Kotlin Language Server (Thanks to Jon Carr) gopls Language Server for Go XML Language Server (lsp4xml) Hack (using HHVM ) Intelephense for PHP clojure-lsp for Clojure/ClojureScipt (Thanks to Dario Benedek Fazekas) elmLS for Elm (Thanks to Daniel-V) FsAutoComplete for F# (Thanks to Reed Mullanix) Added Erlang support via erlang ls Added Dockerfile support via dockerfile-language-server-nodejs New logging options # lsp-mode now logs to buffer *lsp-log* , instead of *Messages* . This can be controlled with the variable lsp-log-max (Thanks to Thomas Fini Hansen). If lsp-print-performance is non-nil, lsp-mode will log a corresponding performance trace to *lsp-log* for every message to and from the server. The variable lsp-print-io , when non-nil will cause lsp-mode to log all messages to and from the server to a unique *lsp-io* buffer for every project root. These logs can be saved to a file and viewed using the LSP Inspector . LSP Methods # Add support for textDocument/prepareRename . If supported by the language server, all renaming operations will be tested for validity. Add support for file watches . Add support for CodeAction literals . Add API level support for folding ranges . Folding support for origami.el support is implemented by package lsp-origami . Support document links . This can be controlled using the variable lsp-enable-links . Support resource operations (edits sent from the language server can now create/modify/remove files and directories). Add support for workspace/configuration . Add new function lsp-disconnect . Added lsp-find-definition-mouse and bound to C-<down-mouse-1> Added lsp-extend-selection as a frontend of new LSP method textDocument/extendSelection Other changes # Add project logo (thanks to Jon Carr). Created an integration test suite for lsp-mode (See directory features ). If available, using the native JSON API introduced in Emacs 27.1. Tramp implementation now uses TRAMP process instead of TCP sockets (Thanks to Karsten Patzwaldt). LSP autoconfiguration adds company-lsp to the list of company backends instead of overriding it. Add lsp-mode-map . Add menu bar entries for lsp-mode . Perform before save operations ( textDocument/willSaveWaitUntil ) asynchronously. imenu support is now handled asynchronously (Thanks to Dario Gjorgjevski). Added option :none for lsp-prefer-flymake , which disabled both Flymake and Flycheck support. Changed flymake to report the errors immediately after they arrive instead of waiting flymake to call lsp-mode . Add debounce when server does not support incremental updates. Add hook lsp-after-uninitialized-hook , which stores the list of functions called after a language server has been uninitialized. Add variable lsp-symbol-highlighting-skip-current , which lets the user skip the current symbol when a given symbol is being highlighted. Add variable lsp-enabled-clients , which lets users set which defined clients are allowed to be used. Support multiple signatures while displaying eldoc text. Add variable lsp-signature-render-all , which when non-nil forces lsp-mode to only show the current active signature. Expose configuration settings for various language servers. Language servers can now be disabled with the variable lsp-disabled-clients . Improved applying changes speed. Fixed xref support for emacs 27+ Implemented automatic installation for F# language server. Added Emacs 26.x to CI Fixed handling of stderr when running over TRAMP . Implemented support for running the language server in Docker container over local files. Release 6.0 # lsp-mode now have single entry point lsp for all language and based on the major mode starts the corresponding language servers. Added flymake integration. lsp automatically enables and configures company-lsp , lsp-ui , yasnippet , or flymake if they are present so no additional configuration is needed except installing the packages. That behavior could be disabled by setting lsp-auto-configure to nil . lsp-mode ships with several predefined servers located in lsp-clients.el which does not require additional package. For the more complex Language Servers like Eclipse JDT , ccls , cquery and haskell we still require separate package due to relatively high code base. lsp-mode handles automatically server failures by asking the user whether he/she wants to restart the server. introduced new command lsp-describe-session which replaces the existing one lsp-capabilities . The command lists the folders that are part of the workspace and the servers that are associated with the corresponding folder. lsp-mode displays information about the running server and it's status in the modeline. lsp-define-stdio-client and lsp-define-tcp-client are replaced with lsp-register-client lsp rely on projectile or project.el now only for suggesting project root. Once you open new file in a project and start lsp it will provide several options(import project, blacklist project, select other directory root). Once you select a root it will be persisted and used for the next sessions. support for multiple language servers per single file and workspace. changed lsp-mode settings to more sensible defaults. Removed all synchronous calls from the server startup.

At the end of this tutorial, Emacs should provide you with all the language-aware editor features you'd expect from a modern C++ IDE, such as Code completion... environment. The guide is mainly focused on lsp-mode / dap-mode and the features that they have. We will use GNU Emacs as a project in order to illustrate each of the steps to get C/C++ project up and running. Some of the main features that we can expect from a C++ IDE: Code completion Real-time syntax checking Code navigation (references/definitions/implementations/symbol search) Visual IDE debugger Document outline, breadcrumb and modeline widgets For all lsp-mode features, check here . Obtaining a language server # lsp-mode is a client-server application with Emacs acting as the client. In order for it to work, you have to install a separate language server that understands the specifics of your target language. As of late 2020, there are 2 production-ready language servers for C/C++ and Objective-C , ccls and clangd , with ccls 's precursor cquery being deprecated. used by Emacs as provider for language specific features (completion, diagnostics, navigation, etc). For some of the language servers lsp-mode ships with automatic installation scripts but there is no such script for installing C/C++ language server due to their overall complexity. For this guide we will be using clangd but most of the steps here apply to ccls as well. lsp-mode is pre-configured and it will be able to find the language server automatically when it is installed on the host machine and it is present on the path. In case clangd is not present on the path clangd can be installed following their Getting Started instructions. Note: for Debian based system use https://apt.llvm.org/ Project setup # To understand your source code, clangd needs to know the compiler flags that are used to build the project. (This is just a fact of life in C++, source files are not self-contained). By default, clangd will assume your code is built as clang some_file.cc , and you\u2019ll probably get spurious errors about missing #included files, etc. There are a couple of ways to fix this. You may read about them in installation or in https://sarcasm.github.io/notes/dev/compilation-database.html.

Note: the project root is needed by the language server in order to know where to start the project discovery from. Typically, this is the git repository root but since exceptions to this rule have caused us a lot of trouble in the past (monorepos come to mind), lsp-mode by default asks the user to manually confirm the project root the first time a project is opened. mono-repos it might be not. lsp-mode by default will ask the user to confirm the project root (automatic root selection has caused a lot of trouble for us in the past). Completion # By default, lsp-mode uses company-mode as its completion frontend. When present, company-mode will be auto-configured and it will just work. keybindings/ which-key integration # lsp-mode has smart (almost) complete mnemonic keybindings which auto-enable itself when a certain feature is supported by the server and when the corresponding Emacs package is installed. In addition to that, lsp-mode ships with which-key integration for better discoverability. By default, lsp-mode 's keybindings are available under s-l (Super-l), e. g. s-l h h will show documentation at point. You may change the default prefix by setting lsp-keymap-prefix . Mouse support # Yeah, lsp-mode supports mouse! Refactoring/Code actions # lsp-rename ( s-l r r ) - rename symbol/function at point. lsp-execute-code-action ( s-l a a ) - clangd is able to auto-correct some of the errors.

Refer to the project's readme for further information. Help/Documentation # lsp-mode automatically enables eldoc-mode which will show hover information in the minibuffer. lsp-mode is showing only the one line signature info so if you want to see the full documentation at point you can use lsp-describe-thing-at-point . In addition to that you can also see signature help after pressing C-M-SPC or after pressing trigger char like ( . If there is more than one applicable signature due to function overloading, you may browse between the available candidates using M-n/M-p . may browse them via M-n/M-p Diagnostics # For on-the-fly errors lsp-mode is using flycheck ( flymake is also supported). It is configured automatically. In addition to standard flycheck features lsp-mode provides a project-wide error list via lsp-treemacs-errors-list . Debugging # Just like lsp-mode provides editing features through the editor-independent Language Server Protocol , its sister package dap-mode provides debugging features through the editor-independent Debug Adapter Protocol and language-specific debugging servers called debug adapters . front-end of the sister Debug Adapter Protocol . It is again client server like Language Sever Protocol . dap-mode provides all of the traditional debugger features - breakpoints(conditions, hit count, etc), threads, locals, Installation # dap-mode provides installation commands for most of the debug adapters. In this tutorial we will use the vscode-cpptools debug adapter. To install the adapter do M-x dap-cpptools-setup . Note: you should have gdb on path. Creating debug configuration # dap-mode introduces the notion of debug configuration and debug template. The debug configuration is the settings that are needed by the debug adapter to start the program to debug. Debug template is a template for such configuration which will be populated by the user or by dap-mode . There are two ways to manage debug configuration - using emacs lisp via dap-debug-edit-template and dap-register-debug-template . The second way is using launch.json . Put it in project root and dap-mode will pick it up. { \"version\" : \"0.2.0\" , \"configurations\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Debug Emacs\" , \"type\" : \"cppdbg\" , \"request\" : \"launch\" , \"program\" : \"${workspaceFolder}/src/emacs\" , \"args\" : [ \"-q\" ], \"stopAtEntry\" : false , \"cwd\" : \"${workspaceFolder}\" , \"environment\" : [], \"externalConsole\" : false , \"MIMode\" : \"gdb\" } ] } At this point, dap-mode does not provide the list of all available properties for each configuration.
