Alternatively, if you want to minimize you configuration you may use prog-mode-hook . In case you do that, lsp will try to start for each programming mode and echo a message when there is no client registered for the current mode or if the corresponding server is not present. In addition, lsp-mode will automatically detect and configure lsp-ui and company-lsp . To turn off that behavior you could set lsp-auto-configure to nil .

JDT LS uses eclipse formatter file and lsp-java-format-settings-url to configure it while clangd uses clangd-format ). The only settings that are controlled on lsp-mode level are indent size and whether the server should use tabs or spaces. Use c-basic-offset for cc-mode derived moves(e. g. java, C++) to control the tab size. Use tab-width for any other mode to do the same. Use indent-tabs-mode for sellecting tab/spaces. Docker Refer to lsp-docker README which provide a guide how you can run lsp-mode in docker container. Performance # When configured properly lsp-mode 's performance is on par with mainstream LSP clients (e. g. VScode , Theia , etc). Here are steps to achieve optimal results. Use Emacs 27+ with native json support. In order to validate that you match this criteria do M-: (functionp 'json-serialize) RET . Benchmarks show that Emacs 27 is ~15 times faster than Emacs when using Elisp json parser implementation. Adjust gc-cons-threshold . The default setting is too low for lsp-mode 's needs due to the fact that client/server communication generates a lot of memory/garbage. You have two options: Set it to big number(100mb) like most of the popular starter kits like Spacemacs/Doom/Prelude, etc do: ( setq gc-cons-threshold 100000000 ) Follow the method recommended by Gnu Emacs Maintainer Eli Zaretskii: \"My suggestion is to repeatedly multiply gc-cons-threshold by 2 until you stop seeing significant improvements in responsiveness, and in any case not to increase by a factor larger than 100 or somesuch. If even a 100-fold increase doesn't help, there's some deeper problem with the Lisp code which produces so much garbage, or maybe GC is not the reason for slowdown.\" Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/brc05y/is_lspmode_too_slow_to_use_for_anyone_else/eofulix/ Increase the amount of data which Emacs reads from the process. Again the emacs default is too low 4k considering that the some of the language server responses are in 800k - 3M range. ( setq read-process-output-max ( * 1024 1024 )) ;; 1mb Optional: use company-capf . Although company-lsp also supports caching lsp-mode 's company-capf does that by default. To achieve that uninstall company-lsp or put these lines in your config: ( setq lsp-prefer-capf t ) Note: - to verify which company backend implementation you are using do M-x company-diag when performing auto-completion. Optional: Disable lsp-ui . Normally, lsp-ui is very fast but in some systems (especially when using Windows ) lsp-ui overlays and popups might slow down emacs. Optional: fine-tune lsp-idle-delay . This variable determines how often lsp-mode will refresh the highlights, lenses, links, etc while you type. ( setq lsp-idle-delay 0.500 ) Reporting performance problems If you have tried all of the non-optional steps from the list and emacs is still not very responsive please open a PR with the following information: Collect lsp-log data after setting lsp-print-performance to t . ( setq lsp-print-performance t ) Include emacs performance report. Use the following step to collect it: M-x profiler-start and select CPU Reproduce the slow behavior. M-x profiler-stop In the profiler report expand all nodes by doing C-u TAB . Note: - lsp-mode is just a frontend and the performance depends on server as well. Some servers (e. g. Palantir's Python Language Server) might be slow when performing auto-completion. How does it work? # lsp-mode has predefined list of server configurations (loaded in lsp-clients.el ) containing a mapping from major-mode to the server configuration or by using activation function. In addition to the default server configuration located in lsp-clients.el there are few languages servers which require separate package(check Supported languages ). When you open a file from a particular project lsp-mode and call lsp command lsp-mode will look for server registrations able to handle current file. If there is such client lsp-mode will look for the project root. If you open a file from the project for the first time you will be prompted to define the current project root. Once the project root is selected it is saved in lsp-session file and it will be loaded the next time you start Emacs so you no longer will be asked for a project root when you open a file from that project. Later if you want to change the project root you may use lsp-workspace-folder-remove to remove the project and call lsp-workspace-folder-add to add the root. If you want to force starting a particular language server in a file you may use C-u M-x lsp which will prompt you to select language server to start. Supported languages # Some of the servers are directly supported by lsp-mode by requiring lsp-clients.el while others require installing additional packages which provide server specific functionality.

In this screenshot, all other font-locking has been disabled (hence no syntax highlighting of comments or basic keywords such as auto ) clang-tidy error explanations (from the clangd language server) Extensions # TRAMP # LSP mode has support for tramp buffers with the following requirements: The language server has to be present on the remote server. Having multi folder language server (like Eclipse JDT LS ) cannot have local and remote workspace folders. How does it work? lsp-mode detects whether a particular file is located on remote machine and looks for a client which matches current file and it is marked as :remote? t. Then lsp-mode starts the client through tramp. Sample configuration Here it is example how you can configure python language server to work when using TRAMP . Note that if you are trying to convert existing language server configuration you should copy all of it's properties(e. g. :request-handlers , activation-fn , etc). ( lsp-register-client ( make-lsp-client :new-connection ( lsp-tramp-connection \"<insert your LS's binary name or path here>\" ) :major-modes ' ( python-mode ) :remote? t :server-id 'pyls-remote )) Dealing with stderr With TRAMP, Emacs does not have an easy way to distinguish stdout and stderr, so when the underlying LSP process writes to stderr, it breaks the lsp-mode parser. As a workaround, lsp-mode is redirecting stderr to /tmp/<process-name>-<id>~stderr . Limitations # File watches # When some of the workspaces that are active in the current project requests file notifications via workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles lsp-mode will start monitoring each of the folders in the workspace for changes. In case your project contains a lot of files you might want to disable file monitoring via lsp-enable-file-watchers (you may use dir-locals). Contributions # Contributions are very much welcome.

If lsp-mode is unable to find the binary but it is on the path it is probably caused by the fact that emacs is running with different path. You may check the current path by executing M-: (getenv \"PATH\") . If this is the case, you have several options to fix the issue. make sure that emacs is using the proper path by running emacs from terminal Modify the path using setpath Look for lsp-mode variable to customize server path. Usually, you may find the variable by doing M-x customize-group RET lsp-LANGUAGE-SERVER-ID . set lsp-log-io to t to inspect communication between client and the server. Use lsp-workspace-show-log to switch to the corresponding log buffer. lsp-describe-session will show the current projects roots + the started severs and allows inspecting the server capabilities. Adding support for languages # Registering server # Here it is the minimal configuration that is needed for new language server registration. Refer to the documentation of lsp-client.el for the additional settings supported on registration time. lsp-language-id-configuration must be updated to contain the corresponding mode -> language id - in this case (python-mode . \"python\") ( defvar lsp-language-id-configuration ' ( ... ( python-mode . \"python\" ) ... )) ;; if you are adding the support for your language server in separate repo use ;; (add-to-list 'lsp-language-id-configuration '(python-mode . \"python\")) ( lsp-register-client ( make-lsp-client :new-connection ( lsp-stdio-connection \"pyls\" ) :major-modes ' ( python-mode ) :server-id 'pyls )) If the language server supports environment variables to control additional behavior, you can register that by using the :environment-fn function, like the Bash language client does: ( lsp-register-client ( make-lsp-client :new-connection ( lsp-stdio-connection ' ( \"bash-language-server\" \"start\" )) :major-modes ' ( sh-mode ) :priority -1 :environment-fn ( lambda () (( \"EXPLAINSHELL_ENDPOINT\" . lsp-bash-explainshell-endpoint ) ( \"HIGHLIGHT_PARSING_ERRORS\" . lsp-bash-highlight-parsing-errors ))) :server-id 'bash-ls )) lsp-bash-explainshell-endpoint and lsp-bash-highlight-parsing-errors are language client defcustom that expose supported server environment settings in a type-safe way. If you change any of those variables, restart the language server with lsp-restart-workspace for the changes to be applied. Sections # lsp-mode provides tools to bridge emacs defcustom as a language configuration sections properties(see specification workspace/configuration ). In addition you may use lsp-generate-settings from Generate Settings script to generate defcustom from package.json VScode plugin manifest. Example: ( defcustom lsp-foo-language-server-property \"bar\" \"Demo property.\" :group 'foo-ls :risky t ) ( lsp-register-custom-settings ' (( \"foo.section.property\" lsp-foo-language-server-property ))) ( lsp-configuration-section \"foo\" ) ;; => ((\"foo\" (\"settings\" (\"property\" . \"bar\")))) FAQ # How do I troubleshoot \"Server FOO-LS:pid exited with status signal. Do you want to restart it? (y or n)\"? This message indicates that the language server has crashed for some reason. You may check the server stderr which is *FOO-LS::stderr* . If you get this message on startup you may try to run the exact command that lsp-mode is running in the terminal. You may find it in *lsp-log* buffer. How to configure a server with local variables?

Benchmarks show that Emacs 27 is ~15 times faster than Emacs when using Elisp json parser implementation. Adjust gc-cons-threshold . The default setting is too low for lsp-mode 's needs due to the fact that client/server communication generates a lot of memory/garbage. You have two options: Set it to big number(100mb) like most of the popular starter kits like Spacemacs/Doom/Prelude, etc do: ( setq gc-cons-threshold 100000000 ) Follow the method recommended by Gnu Emacs Maintainer Eli Zaretskii: \"My suggestion is to repeatedly multiply gc-cons-threshold by 2 until you stop seeing significant improvements in responsiveness, and in any case not to increase by a factor larger than 100 or somesuch.

To achieve that uninstall company-lsp or put these lines in your config: ( setq lsp-prefer-capf t ) Note: - to verify which company backend implementation you are using do M-x company-diag when performing auto-completion. Optional: Disable lsp-ui . Normally, lsp-ui is very fast but in some systems (especially when using Windows ) lsp-ui overlays and popups might slow down emacs. Optional: fine-tune lsp-idle-delay .
