Here are the most important features/news in 7.0 release lsp-mode/the team/the ecosystem # lsp-mode team and the activity in the repo has vastly increased. lsp-mode is no longer one man project but it is a product of Emacs LSP team and emacs community. This has allowed us to implement some very time consuming changes/refactoring(more about them bellow) which an year ago were unthinkable due to the lack manpower. emacs-lsp repo has become a nice place to start contributing to open source or learn elisp and now there are 244 contributors in the main repo. Even more some of the current maintainers had zero elisp knowledge before doing their first lsp-mode contributions. We started moving out some of the server specific packages(e. g. lsp-dart maintained by ericdallo and lsp-metals maintained by kurnevsky , lsp-python-ms by seagle0128 , etc) in order to provide focused support by a an expert in the language at hand. Considering where we were few months ago the level of integrated experience provided by those packages has increased and often it is comparable with backed by paid full time developers editors like VScode . Here it is a gif illustrating that: lsp-dart . LSP in its nature should be language agnostic but in order to be comparable with VScode lsp-mode should support language server extensions as well which is much more work than the work on protocol itself and requires a constant monitoring of the server repo since there is no contract and the server team might change the contract whenever they want. On the bright side lsp-mode has attracted several server side developers or lsp-mode team members(e. g. mpanarin ) has become server side contributors and often we are ahead of changes or we directly address issues in the server when they arise. We are still looking for maintainer(s) for JS/TS suite( typescript-language-server , eslint , angular ) though. Major features # 3.16 spec support # We provided full support for 3.14 features one year after the version has been released. Now, we have support for all major features of 3.16 protocol even before it has been released (except for result streaming which apparently hasn't been implemented by any language server). New website # It is created ericdallo - here it is the website . Check it out and eventually provide feedback. Semantic highlights # This is part of 3.16 spec. It is implemented by sebastiansturm and it can be enabled by setting lsp-enable-semantic-highlighting . We have dropped the Theia protocol support for semantic highlighting since it is not going to make to the official spec. ATM it is supported by Rust Analyzer , Clangd (from master branch) and lua language server. org-mode integration(preview) # org-mode mode is the Emacs flagman and this integration brings up the literate programming to a new level. The integration is pretty raw but usable - you basically can run lsp-mode language intelligence over org-mode source block directly in the org-mode document. We have achieved that by creating virtual buffer abstraction which allows us to fake the server that the client has actually opened the real file. Check gif and the docs . I think that the ability to implement such features is why Emacs is editor in a league of its own . And implementing such features is one of the signs that we are slowly moving from the phase catching up into getting ahead (or maybe I am overly optimistic). Language Server Protocol bindings, upcoming changes # We generated json schema from the protocol and from that schema we generated dash destructoring, getters, setters, validators, constructors, indication for optional/required fields, etc. which allow us to perform compile time validation of the protocol usage. This was huge change because we had to walk through almost all methods and replace explicit access to the elisp data structure with protocol usage. At the same time, emacs-lsp organization has more than 20k lines of code. This was coordinated effort and a lot of individuals contributed to that. The benefits are that we now can switch the underlying data structure from hashmap to plists which will yield better performance and also that the overall quality of the codebase has increased. Example Before: ( defun lsp--position-to-point ( params ) \"Convert Position object in PARAMS to a point.\" ( lsp--line-character-to-point ( gethash \"line\" params ) ( gethash \"character\" params ))) After: ( lsp-defun lsp--position-to-point (( &Position :line :character )) \"Convert `Position' object in PARAMS to a point.\" ( lsp--line-character-to-point line character )) In this example :line and :character are validated as fields of Position structure. Also, we do some handy conversions, if the field is optional it will end up with ? like :foo? . To reduce boiler plate code we convert camelCase to :camel-case when we are destructoring it. Performance optimizations(flycheck, code completion) # We have rewritten the flycheck integration - the new integration provides the same UE as the old one but it is much more effective in reporting the errors to flycheck and lsp checker is much closer to the traditional flycheck checkers which are initiated/controlled from Emacs . Completion integration code is now much simpler/faster thanks to kiennq . What's next # Upcoming breaking changes Dropping Emacs 25 support. This will allow us utilize Emacs multi-threading to improve lsp-mode responsibility Switching from hashtables to plists - once this change goes in users must recompile all lsp-mode extensions. Drop company-lsp support(not ported to use lsp-protocol.el ) Implementing lsp-mode configuration wizard to improve beginners experience - check this issue for more details. The overall goal is let user pick settings for all features that are opinionated (e. g. lsp-ui ) and improve the discoverability of lsp-mode features/extensions/settings. We will try to switch to monthly/weakly release cycles and to different person for writing the announcements. We might eventually encourage melpa-stable usage.","title":"7.0 Release"},{"location":"blog/2020/7.0-release/#70-release","text":"I am pleased to announce lsp-mode 7.0!

This can be controlled with the variable lsp-log-max (Thanks to Thomas Fini Hansen). If lsp-print-performance is non-nil, lsp-mode will log a corresponding performance trace to *lsp-log* for every message to and from the server. The variable lsp-print-io , when non-nil will cause lsp-mode to log all messages to and from the server to a unique *lsp-io* buffer for every project root. These logs can be saved to a file and viewed using the LSP Inspector . LSP Methods # Add support for textDocument/prepareRename . If supported by the language server, all renaming operations will be tested for validity. Add support for file watches . Add support for CodeAction literals . Add API level support for folding ranges . Folding support for origami.el support is implemented by package lsp-origami . Support document links . This can be controlled using the variable lsp-enable-links . Support resource operations (edits sent from the language server can now create/modify/remove files and directories). Add support for workspace/configuration . Add new function lsp-disconnect . Added lsp-find-definition-mouse and bound to C-<down-mouse-1> Added lsp-extend-selection as a frontend of new LSP method textDocument/extendSelection Other changes # Add project logo (thanks to Jon Carr). Created an integration test suite for lsp-mode (See directory features ). If available, using the native JSON API introduced in Emacs 27.1. Tramp implementation now uses TRAMP process instead of TCP sockets (Thanks to Karsten Patzwaldt). LSP autoconfiguration adds company-lsp to the list of company backends instead of overriding it. Add lsp-mode-map . Add menu bar entries for lsp-mode . Perform before save operations ( textDocument/willSaveWaitUntil ) asynchronously. imenu support is now handled asynchronously (Thanks to Dario Gjorgjevski). Added option :none for lsp-prefer-flymake , which disabled both Flymake and Flycheck support. Changed flymake to report the errors immediately after they arrive instead of waiting flymake to call lsp-mode . Add debounce when server does not support incremental updates. Add hook lsp-after-uninitialized-hook , which stores the list of functions called after a language server has been uninitialized. Add variable lsp-symbol-highlighting-skip-current , which lets the user skip the current symbol when a given symbol is being highlighted. Add variable lsp-enabled-clients , which lets users set which defined clients are allowed to be used. Support multiple signatures while displaying eldoc text. Add variable lsp-signature-render-all , which when non-nil forces lsp-mode to only show the current active signature. Expose configuration settings for various language servers. Language servers can now be disabled with the variable lsp-disabled-clients . Improved applying changes speed. Fixed xref support for emacs 27+ Implemented automatic installation for F# language server. Added Emacs 26.x to CI Fixed handling of stderr when running over TRAMP . Implemented support for running the language server in Docker container over local files. Release 6.0 # lsp-mode now have single entry point lsp for all language and based on the major mode starts the corresponding language servers. Added flymake integration. lsp automatically enables and configures company-lsp , lsp-ui , yasnippet , or flymake if they are present so no additional configuration is needed except installing the packages. That behavior could be disabled by setting lsp-auto-configure to nil . lsp-mode ships with several predefined servers located in lsp-clients.el which does not require additional package. For the more complex Language Servers like Eclipse JDT , ccls , cquery and haskell we still require separate package due to relatively high code base. lsp-mode handles automatically server failures by asking the user whether he/she wants to restart the server. introduced new command lsp-describe-session which replaces the existing one lsp-capabilities . The command lists the folders that are part of the workspace and the servers that are associated with the corresponding folder. lsp-mode displays information about the running server and it's status in the modeline. lsp-define-stdio-client and lsp-define-tcp-client are replaced with lsp-register-client lsp rely on projectile or project.el now only for suggesting project root. Once you open new file in a project and start lsp it will provide several options(import project, blacklist project, select other directory root). Once you select a root it will be persisted and used for the next sessions. support for multiple language servers per single file and workspace. changed lsp-mode settings to more sensible defaults. Removed all synchronous calls from the server startup.

This uses Symfony`s Finder in the background, so this means you can configure anything here that can also be passed to the name function, which includes plain strings, globs, as well as regular expressions. Note that for existing projects, modifying these will not not automatically prune them from the index if they are already present. lsp-serenata-file-extensions # Type: lsp-string-vector Default: [php] List of file extensions (without dot) to process. Files that do not match this whitelist will be ignored during indexing. Usually you`ll want to set this to at least include php, as it is the most common PHP extension. phpt is not included by default as it is often used to contain test code that is not directly part of the code.

Note that, as the index database uses SQLite and WAL mode, additional files (usually two) may be generated and used in the same folder. Note also that Serenata relies on the Doctrine DBAL library as well as the SQLite backends in PHP, which may not support non-file URI`s, which may prevent you from using these. lsp-serenata-php-version # Type: number Default: 7.3 Allows you to specify the PHP version your project is written in.

This does not have to include the root of the project itself, in case you have need of an exotic configuration where the root of the project is at some location but your actual PHP code is somewhere else. Note that if you are running Serenata in a container, you will have to ensure that these URI`s are mapped inside it. Avoid using file paths containing spaces.

JDT LS uses eclipse formatter file and lsp-java-format-settings-url to configure it while clangd uses clangd-format and lsp-dart uses the built-in dartfmt from Dart SDK ). The only settings that are controlled on lsp-mode level are indent size and whether the server should use tabs or spaces. Refer to lsp--formatting-indent-alist to find out what is the variable that is used for the current major mode. Some language servers, e.g. for C++, Java, etc, can format code as you type and the formatting is triggered when the corresponding character is pressed(typically, } , RET ). This behaviour is controlled via lsp-enable-on-type-formatting and it is enabled by default.

Obtaining a language server # lsp-mode is a client-server application with Emacs acting as the client. In order for it to work, you have to install a separate language server that understands the specifics of your target language. As of late 2020, there are 2 production-ready language servers for C/C++ and Objective-C , clangd , and ccls with ccls 's precursor cquery being deprecated. For some of the language servers, lsp-mode ships with automatic installation scripts but there is no such script for installing a C/C++ language server due to their overall complexity. For this guide we will be using clangd but most of the steps here apply to ccls as well. lsp-mode is pre-configured and it will be able to find the language server automatically when it is installed on the host machine and it is present on the PATH . In case clangd is not present on the path clangd can be installed following their Getting Started instructions. Note: for Debian based system use https://apt.llvm.org/ Project setup # To understand your source code, clangd needs to know the compiler flags that are used to build the project. (This is just a fact of life in C++, source files are not self-contained). By default, clangd will assume your code is built as clang some_file.cc , and you\u2019ll probably get spurious errors about missing #include files, etc. There are a couple of ways to fix this.

Note: the project root is needed by the language server in order to know where to start the project discovery from. Typically, this is the git repository root but since exceptions to this rule have caused us a lot of trouble in the past (monorepos come to mind), lsp-mode by default asks the user to manually confirm the project root the first time a project is opened. Completion # By default, lsp-mode uses company-mode as its completion frontend. When present, company-mode will be auto-configured and it will just work. keybindings/ which-key integration # lsp-mode has smart (almost) complete mnemonic keybindings which auto-enable when a certain feature is supported by the server and when the corresponding Emacs package is installed. In addition, lsp-mode ships with which-key integration for better discoverability. By default, lsp-mode 's keybindings are available under s-l (Super-l), e. g. s-l h h will show documentation at point. You may change the default prefix by setting lsp-keymap-prefix . Mouse support # Yeah, lsp-mode supports mouse! Refactoring/Code actions # lsp-rename ( s-l r r ) - rename symbol/function at point. lsp-execute-code-action ( s-l a a ) - clangd is able to auto-correct some of the errors. Navigation # lsp-mode has integration with xref core package and in addition it has xref-find-definitions ( M-. and s-l g g ) - find definition(s) at point xref-find-references ( s-l g r ) - find references to the symbol at point helm-imenu - browse symbols in the current document helm-lsp-workspace-symbol - find symbol in current project helm-lsp-global-workspaces-symbol - find symbol in all projects lsp-treemacs-type-hierarchy - show type hierarchy Note: if you prefer ivy over helm you may check out lsp-ivy . lsp-treemacs # lsp-treemacs is a package providing integration with treemacs and an alternative tree-view visualization. Refer to the project's readme for further information. Help/Documentation # lsp-mode automatically enables eldoc-mode which will show hover information in the minibuffer. lsp-mode is showing only the one line signature info so if you want to see the full documentation at point you can use lsp-describe-thing-at-point . In addition to that you can also see signature help after pressing C-M-SPC or after pressing trigger char like ( . If there is more than one applicable signature due to function overloading, you may browse between the available candidates using M-n/M-p . may browse them via M-n/M-p Diagnostics # For on-the-fly errors lsp-mode is using flycheck ( flymake is also supported). It is configured automatically. In addition to standard flycheck features lsp-mode provides a project-wide error list via lsp-treemacs-errors-list . Debugging # Just like lsp-mode provides editing features through the editor-independent Language Server Protocol , its sister package dap-mode provides debugging features through the editor-independent Debug Adapter Protocol and language-specific debugging servers called debug adapters . front-end of the sister Debug Adapter Protocol . It is again client server like Language Sever Protocol . dap-mode provides all of the traditional debugger features - breakpoints(conditions, hit count, etc), threads, locals. Installation # dap-mode provides installation commands for most of the debug adapters. In this tutorial we will use the vscode-cpptools debug adapter. To install the adapter do M-x dap-cpptools-setup . Note: you should have gdb on path. Note: on linux you should install mono . Creating debug configuration # dap-mode introduces the notion of debug configuration and debug template. The debug configuration is the settings that are needed by the debug adapter to start the program to debug. Debug template is a template for such configuration which will be populated by the user or by dap-mode . There are two ways to manage debug configuration - using emacs lisp via dap-debug-edit-template and dap-register-debug-template . The second way is using launch.json . Put it in project root and dap-mode will pick it up. { \"version\" : \"0.2.0\" , \"configurations\" : [ { \"name\" : \"Debug Emacs\" , \"type\" : \"cppdbg\" , \"request\" : \"launch\" , \"program\" : \"${workspaceFolder}/src/emacs\" , \"args\" : [ \"-q\" ], \"stopAtEntry\" : false , \"cwd\" : \"${workspaceFolder}\" , \"environment\" : [], \"externalConsole\" : false , \"MIMode\" : \"gdb\" } ] } At this point, dap-mode does not provide the list of all available properties for each configuration. The full list can be found in package.json in /.emacs.d/.extension/vscode/cpptools/extension/package.json when dap-mode is using VScode package or debug adapter docs when not. Debugging # Start debugging via M-x dap-debug and select Debug Emacs from the list. . After pressing RET a fresh instance of Emacs will pop up. Then do M-x helm-lsp-workspace-symbol and type message3 . Go to that function and place a breakpoint. You could do that by clicking in the fringe or by doing M-x dap-breakpoint-toggle .

Why should I try LSP for Clojure? # Coming from the Java world, when I started programming for Clojure in Emacs, it was odd to me that for almost everything you needed to do with Clojure, you needed a REPL running in your project , and if you changed anything in your project, you would need to reload the modified namespace/code to see the changes in the REPL. I also missed a lot of features popularized by Java IDEs, like cleaning unused imports, viewing the call hierarchy of a method/function, formatting code automatically, checking syntax in real-time, and using code actions that could, for example, add a missing import. Ever since I found clojure-lsp , which implements most of those features, I have been using it alongside CIDER without issues. While I really like CIDER and believe it is one of the best tools for Clojure development, you can complement it with clojure-lsp to make programming in Clojure even better. Once it is running (and you are plugged into the REPL), CIDER will provide many of the same features that clojure-lsp does, so you need to tell Emacs how to resolve conflicts. Therefore, if you want to have a more IDE-ish experience with Emacs, you should read this guide. Basic configuration # Here is a bare-bones lsp-mode configuration template to get you started with your own lsp-mode config, or to try out in a separate one-off session.

Installing the language server # lsp-mode is a client-server application with Emacs acting as the client. In order for it to work, you have to install a separate language server that understands the specifics of your target language. For Clojure, we will use clojure-lsp which as of 2021/01, is the only LSP server for Clojure, and has a lot of useful features that I will try to show in this guide. Via lsp-mode # lsp-mode ships with automatic installation scripts for some of the language servers and clojure-lsp is one of the supported servers, you can install it using M-x lsp-install-server RET clojure-lsp . After installed, lsp-mode will automatically initialize it when opening Clojure files. Manually # Check here for more information on how to build it manually. For a custom path, you can set the path of the server location with: ( setq lsp-clojure-custom-server-command ' ( \"bash\" \"-c\" \"/path/to/clojure-lsp\" )) LSP features # This guide will focus on the features of lsp-mode that are most relevant to Clojure development. You can view documentation of all features at the official lsp-mode site or clojure-lsp features section . Syntax check # It checks for errors and warnings on your code while you write it, it uses clj-kondo , another amazing library that lints Clojure code, in the back-end so it's not required to install clj-kondo since clojure-lsp will use it automatically. It will also check for public unused functions/variables which is something that, as far as I know, does not exist in any other Clojure library/package: Find definition/references # You can find a function definition with lsp-find-definition or find all the references to that symbol, variable or function with lsp-find-references or lsp-ui-peek-find-references if lsp-ui is available.

When present, company-mode and enabled for lsp-mode , it will be auto-configured and it will just work using the completion items returned by the LSP server. clojure-lsp also has completion snippets, for more information check here . If you do not want LSP completion, It's possible to use cider completion instead with: ( setq lsp-enable-completion-at-point nil ) ; use cider completion See also CIDER code completion Code lens # LSP supports code lenses, actionable text snippets that a server may want to display in a client IDE. clojure-lsp uses it to show the reference count of a function/variable. They are disabled by default so you need to manually enable them via: ( setq lsp-lens-enable t ) Call hierarchy # This feature returns the call hierarchy of a function/method. As of now, clojure-lsp only supports returning the incoming-call hierarchy. It uses lsp-treemacs , which you should install to use this feature. Formatting # For LSP formatting, clojure-lsp use cljfmt with support for all known cljfmt settings. You can format a region with lsp-format-region or the entire buffer with lsp-format-buffer . Code actions # One of the most important features considered by me is the code actions feature provided by the server. they are refactoring actions that may change your code after applied, clojure-lsp some of the refactorings from below are suggested by the server depending where user cursor is, for example Add missing namespace where clojure-lsp will suggest adding a missing require: Refactorings # clojure-lsp also has a lot of refactorings, some of them can be automatically triggered by code actions like said above and others manually by user, one example of one of the most used by me is clean-ns , which will remove any unused requires and refers: Or rename which will rename the symbol at point and all usages/references: For more info on all available refactorings, check here . Conflict with clj-refactor when creating new files clj-refactor and clojure-lsp have a feature of add the namespace form for new created files, but they may conflict if both are enable, inserting duplicated namespace forms.

The Emacs editor supports React.js IntelliSense and code navigation out of the box. Welcome to React # We'll be using the create-react-app generator for this tutorial. To use the generator as well as to run the React application server, you'll need the Node.js JavaScript runtime and npm (Node.js package manager) installed. npm is included with Node.js, which you can download and install from Node.js downloads . Tip : To test that you have Node.js and npm correctly installed on your machine, you can type node --version and npm --version in a terminal or command prompt. You can now create a new React application by typing: npx create-react-app my-app where my-app is the name of the folder for your React application. It may take a few minutes to create it and to install its dependencies. Note : If you've previously installed create-react-app globally via npm install -g create-react-app , we recommend you uninstall the package using npm uninstall -g create-react-app to ensure that npx always uses the latest version. Let's quickly run our React application by navigating to the new folder and typing npm start to start the web server and to open the application in a browser: cd my-app npm start You should see the React logo and a link to \"Learn React\" on http://localhost:3000 in your browser. We'll leave the web server running while we look at the application with Emacs.

Installing the typescript language server # Emacs supports automatic language server installation, so the first time you run M-x lsp in a JavaScript file opened in it, you will be prompted for a language server to install. Select ts-ls . Importing the project # Then you have to select project root. Press i . Syntax highlighting and bracket matching # You'll notice that Emacs has syntax highlighting for the various source code elements and, if you put the cursor on a parenthesis, the matching bracket is also selected. IntelliSense # As you start typing in index.js , you'll see smart suggestions or completions. After you select a suggestion and type . , you see the types and methods on the object through IntelliSense . Emacs uses the TypeScript language service for its JavaScript code intelligence and it has a feature called Automatic Type Acquisition (ATA). ATA pulls down the npm Type Declaration files ( *.d.ts ) for the npm modules referenced in the package.json . If you select a method, you'll also get parameter help: Go to Definition, Peek definition # Through the TypeScript language service, Emacs can also provide type definition information in the editor through Go to Definition ( M-. ) or Peek Definition ( M-x lsp-ui-peek-find-definitions ). Put the cursor over the App , right click and select Go to definition . Note : Peek definition requires installing lsp-ui package which is not part of the default installation. Hello World! # Let's update the sample application to \"Hello World!\". Add the link to declare a new H1 header and replace the <App /> tag in ReactDOM.render with element . import React from 'react' ; import ReactDOM from 'react-dom' ; import './index.css' ; import App from './App' ; import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals' ; var element = React . createElement ( 'h1' , { className : 'greeting' }, 'Hello, world!' ); ReactDOM . render ( element , document . getElementById ( 'root' )); reportWebVitals (); Once you save the index.js file, the running instance of the server will update the web page and you'll see \"Hello World!\". Debugging React # To debug the client side React code, we'll need to install the Debugger for Chrome extension. Note: This tutorial assumes you have the Chrome browser installed. There are also debugger extensions for the Edge and Firefox browsers. Press M-x and type dap-chrome-setup . Set a breakpoint # To set a breakpoint in index.js , click on the gutter to the left of the line numbers. This will set a breakpoint which will be visible as a red circle. Configure the Chrome debugger # We need to initially configure the debugger . To do so, create a launch.json file in the .vscode/ subfolder of the project root with a configuration to launch the website: { \"version\" : \"0.2.0\" , \"configurations\" : [ { \"type\" : \"chrome\" , \"request\" : \"launch\" , \"name\" : \"Launch Chrome against localhost\" , \"url\" : \"http://localhost:3000\" , \"webRoot\" : \"${workspaceFolder}\" } ] } Ensure that your development server is running ( npm start ). Then type M-x dap-debug or use Debug -> Start menu. The source code where the breakpoint is set runs on startup before the debugger was attached, so we won't hit the breakpoint until we refresh the web page. Refresh the page and you should hit your breakpoint. You can step through your source code using M-x dap-next , inspect variables such as element , and see the call stack of the client side React application. The Debugger for Chrome extension README has lots of information on other configurations, working with sourcemaps, and troubleshooting. You can review it their README Live editing and debugging # If you are using webpack together with your React app, you can have a more efficient workflow by taking advantage of webpack's HMR mechanism which enables you to have live editing and debugging directly from Emacs. You can learn more in this Live edit and debug your React apps directly from Emacs(TO BE PORTED TO EMACS) blog post and the webpack Hot Module Replacement documentation(TO BE PORTED TO EMACS) . Linting # Linters analyze your source code and can warn about potential problems before running your application. The JavaScript language service included with Emacs has syntax error checking support by default, which you can see in action in the Errors List panel ( M-x lsp-treemacs-errors-list ). Try making a small error in your React source code and you'll see a red squiggle and an error in the Errors List panel. Linters can provide more sophisticated analysis, enforcing coding conventions and detecting anti-patterns. A popular JavaScript linter is ESLint . ESLint, when combined with the ESLint Emacs extension , provides a great in-product linting experience. First, install the ESLint command-line tool: npm install -g eslint Then install the ESLint language server by doing M-x lsp-install-server RET eslint RET . Once the ESLint extension is installed, you'll want to create an ESLint configuration file, .eslintrc.js . You can create one using M-x lsp-eslint-create-default-configuration . The command will prompt you to answer a series of questions in a separate window. Accept the defaults, and it will create a .eslintrc.js file in your project root that looks something like this: module . exports = { \"env\" : { \"browser\" : true , \"es2020\" : true }, \"extends\" : [ \"eslint:recommended\" , \"plugin:react/recommended\" ], \"parserOptions\" : { \"ecmaFeatures\" : { \"jsx\" : true }, \"ecmaVersion\" : 11 , \"sourceType\" : \"module\" }, \"plugins\" : [ \"react\" ], \"rules\" : { } }; ESLint will now analyze open files and shows a warning in index.js about 'App' being defined but never used. You can modify the ESLint rules in the .eslintrc.js file. Let's add an error rule for extra semi-colons: \"rules\" : { \"no-extra-semi\" : \"error\" } Now when you mistakenly have multiple semicolons on a line, you'll see an error (red squiggle) in the editor and error entry in the Problems panel. Popular Starter Kits # In this tutorial, we used the create-react-app generator to create a simple React application. There are lots of great samples and starter kits available to help build your first React application. TypeScript React # If you're curious about TypeScript and React, you can also create a TypeScript version of the create-react-app application.

Accept the defaults, and it will create a .eslintrc.js file in your project root that looks something like this: module . exports = { \"env\" : { \"browser\" : true , \"es2020\" : true }, \"extends\" : [ \"eslint:recommended\" , \"plugin:react/recommended\" ], \"parserOptions\" : { \"ecmaFeatures\" : { \"jsx\" : true }, \"ecmaVersion\" : 11 , \"sourceType\" : \"module\" }, \"plugins\" : [ \"react\" ], \"rules\" : { } }; ESLint will now analyze open files and shows a warning in index.js about 'App' being defined but never used. You can modify the ESLint rules in the .eslintrc.js file. Let's add an error rule for extra semi-colons: \"rules\" : { \"no-extra-semi\" : \"error\" } Now when you mistakenly have multiple semicolons on a line, you'll see an error (red squiggle) in the editor and error entry in the Problems panel.","title":"Linting"},{"location":"tutorials/reactjs-tutorial/#popular-starter-kits","text":"In this tutorial, we used the create-react-app generator to create a simple React application.
