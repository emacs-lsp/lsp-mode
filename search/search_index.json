This can be controlled with the variable lsp-log-max (Thanks to Thomas Fini Hansen). If lsp-print-performance is non-nil, lsp-mode will log a corresponding performance trace to *lsp-log* for every message to and from the server. The variable lsp-print-io , when non-nil will cause lsp-mode to log all messages to and from the server to a unique *lsp-io* buffer for every project root. These logs can be saved to a file and viewed using the LSP Inspector . LSP Methods # Add support for textDocument/prepareRename . If supported by the language server, all renaming operations will be tested for validity. Add support for file watches . Add support for CodeAction literals .

Added lsp-find-definition-mouse and bound to C-<down-mouse-1> Added lsp-extend-selection as a frontend of new LSP method textDocument/extendSelection Other changes # Add project logo (thanks to Jon Carr).

Tramp implementation now uses TRAMP process instead of TCP sockets (Thanks to Karsten Patzwaldt). LSP autoconfiguration adds company-lsp to the list of company backends instead of overriding it. Add lsp-mode-map . Add menu bar entries for lsp-mode . Perform before save operations ( textDocument/willSaveWaitUntil ) asynchronously. imenu support is now handled asynchronously (Thanks to Dario Gjorgjevski). Added option :none for lsp-prefer-flymake , which disabled both Flymake and Flycheck support.

Add variable lsp-enabled-clients , which lets users set which defined clients are allowed to be used. Support multiple signatures while displaying eldoc text. Add variable lsp-signature-render-all , which when non-nil forces lsp-mode to only show the current active signature. Expose configuration settings for various language servers. Language servers can now be disabled with the variable lsp-disabled-clients . Improved applying changes speed. Fixed xref support for emacs 27+ Implemented automatic installation for F# language server. Added Emacs 26.x to CI Fixed handling of stderr when running over TRAMP . Implemented support for running the language server in Docker container over local files. Release 6.0 # lsp-mode now have single entry point lsp for all language and based on the major mode starts the corresponding language servers. Added flymake integration. lsp automatically enables and configures company-lsp , lsp-ui , yasnippet , or flymake if they are present so no additional configuration is needed except installing the packages.

For the more complex Language Servers like Eclipse JDT , ccls , cquery and haskell we still require separate package due to relatively high code base. lsp-mode handles automatically server failures by asking the user whether he/she wants to restart the server. introduced new command lsp-describe-session which replaces the existing one lsp-capabilities . The command lists the folders that are part of the workspace and the servers that are associated with the corresponding folder. lsp-mode displays information about the running server and it's status in the modeline. lsp-define-stdio-client and lsp-define-tcp-client are replaced with lsp-register-client lsp rely on projectile or project.el now only for suggesting project root. Once you open new file in a project and start lsp it will provide several options(import project, blacklist project, select other directory root). Once you select a root it will be persisted and used for the next sessions. support for multiple language servers per single file and workspace. changed lsp-mode settings to more sensible defaults. Removed all synchronous calls from the server startup.
