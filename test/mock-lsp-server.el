;;; Commentary:

;; A mock implementation of a Language Server Protocol server for testing
;; of the LSP client in lsp-mode.
;;
;; The server reads commands from a file `mock-server-commands.el` in the same
;; directory as this file. The commands are elisp code that is loaded and
;; executed by the server. It deletes the file after executing the command
;; indicating readiness for the next one.
;;
;; Due to `emacs --script` limitations, the server cannot watch two inputs
;; concurrently:
;; - stdin for the client input
;; - the mock-server-commands.el file for the commands
;;
;; Therefore, the server alternates between the two. It waits for the next
;; client input, and only after processing one can take and execute a command.
;; As a consequence, you should make sure to send a notification from the client
;; once you have created the command file with a command.

;;; Code:

(require 'json)

;; To ease debugging, print the stack trace on failure
