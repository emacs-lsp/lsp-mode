;;; Commentary:

;; A collection of tests that check lsp-mode interaction with
;; an lsp server mocked by mock-lsp-server.el
;; The tests define a custom lsp client execute scenarios
;; such as opening a file, chagning it, or receiving updated diagnostics
;; and assert how lsp-mode updates the diagnostics.
