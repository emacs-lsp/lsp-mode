*** New logging options
   - =lsp-mode= now logs to buffer =*lsp-log*=, instead of =*Messages*=. This
     can be controlled with the variable =lsp-log-max= (Thanks to Thomas Fini Hansen).
   - If =lsp-print-performance= is non-nil, =lsp-mode= will log a corresponding
     performance trace to =*lsp-log*= for every message to and from the server.
   - The variable =lsp-print-io=, when non-nil will cause =lsp-mode= to log
     all messages to and from the server to a unique =*lsp-io*= buffer for every
     project root. These logs can be saved to a file and viewed using the
     [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/inspector/][LSP Inspector]].

*** LSP Methods

     =lsp-enable-links=.

     create/modify/remove files and directories).

    of waiting =flymake= to call =lsp-mode=.
  - Add debounce when server does not support incremental updates.
  - Add hook =lsp-after-uninitialized-hook=, which stores the list of functions
    called after a language server has been uninitialized.
  - Add variable =lsp-symbol-highlighting-skip-current=, which lets the user skip
    the current symbol when a given symbol is being highlighted.
  - Add variable =lsp-enabled-clients=, which lets users set which defined clients
    are allowed to be used.
  - Support multiple signatures while displaying eldoc text. Add variable
    =lsp-signature-render-all=, which when non-nil forces =lsp-mode= to only show
    the current active signature.
  - Expose configuration settings for various language servers.
  - Language servers can now be disabled with the variable =lsp-disabled-clients=.
  - Improved applying changes speed.

** Release 6.0
  - ~lsp-mode~ now have single entry point ~lsp~ for all language and based on the major mode starts the corresponding language servers.
  - Added ~flymake~ integration.
  - ~lsp~ automatically enables and configures ~company-lsp~, ~lsp-ui~, ~yasnippet~, or ~flymake~ if they are present so no additional configuration is needed except installing the packages. That behavior could be disabled by setting ~lsp-auto-configure~ to ~nil~.
  - ~lsp-mode~ ships with several predefined servers located in ~lsp-clients.el~ which does not require additional package. For the more complex Language Servers like ~Eclipse JDT~, ~ccls~, ~cquery~ and ~haskell~ we still require separate package due to relatively high code base.
  - ~lsp-mode~ handles automatically server failures by asking the user whether he/she wants to restart the server.
  - introduced new command ~lsp-describe-session~ which replaces the existing one ~lsp-capabilities~. The command lists the folders that are part of the workspace and the servers that are associated with the corresponding folder.
  - ~lsp-mode~ displays information about the running server and it's status in the modeline.
  - ~lsp-define-stdio-client~ and ~lsp-define-tcp-client~ are replaced with ~lsp-register-client~
  - ~lsp~ rely on ~projectile~ or ~project.el~ now only for suggesting project root. Once you open new file in a project and start ~lsp~ it will provide several options(import project, blacklist project, select other directory root). Once you select a root it will be persisted and used for the next sessions.
  - support for multiple language servers per single file and workspace.
  - changed ~lsp-mode~ settings to more sensible defaults.
  - Removed all synchronous calls from the server startup.
  - Improved multi-folder support.
  - added backends for: Bash, C++, CSS, Dart, Elixir, Fortran, Go, Groovy, HTML, Javascript/Typescript, Javascript/Typescript, Ocaml, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Vue, Flow
