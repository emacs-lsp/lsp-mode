*** New logging options
   - =lsp-mode= now logs to buffer =*lsp-log*=, instead of =*Messages*=. This
     can be controlled with the variable =lsp-log-max= (Thanks to Thomas Fini Hansen).
   - If =lsp-print-performance= is non-nil, =lsp-mode= will log a corresponding
     performance trace to =*lsp-log*= for every message to and from the server.
   - The variable =lsp-print-io=, when non-nil will cause =lsp-mode= to log
     all messages to and from the server to a unique =*lsp-io*= buffer for every
     project root. These logs can be saved to a file and viewed using the
     [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/inspector/][LSP Inspector]].

*** LSP Methods
   - Add support for [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#textDocument_prepareRename][textDocument/prepareRename]]. If supported by the language
     server, all renaming operations will be tested for validity.
   - Add support for [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#workspace_didChangeWatchedFiles][file watches]].
   - Add support for [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#textDocument_codeAction][CodeAction literals]].
   - Add API level support for [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#textDocument_foldingRange][folding ranges]]. Folding support for [[https://github.com/gregsexton/origami.el][origami.el]]
     support is implemented by package [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-origami][lsp-origami]].
   - Support [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#textDocument_documentLink][document links]]. This can be controlled using the variable
     =lsp-enable-links=.
   - Support resource operations (edits sent from the language server can now
     create/modify/remove files and directories).
   - Add support for [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#workspace_configuration][workspace/configuration]].
   - Add new function =lsp-disconnect=.
   - Added =lsp-find-definition-mouse= and bound to =C-<down-mouse-1>=
   - Added =lsp-extend-selection= as a frontend of new LSP method =textDocument/extendSelection=

*** Other changes
  - Add project logo (thanks to Jon Carr).
  - Created an integration test suite for =lsp-mode= (See directory =features=).
  - If available, using the native JSON API introduced in Emacs 27.1.
  - Tramp implementation now uses TRAMP process instead of TCP sockets (Thanks to
    Karsten Patzwaldt).
  - LSP autoconfiguration adds =company-lsp= to the list of company backends
    instead of overriding it.
  - Add =lsp-mode-map=.
  - Add menu bar entries for =lsp-mode=.
  - Perform _before save_ operations ([[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#textDocument_willSaveWaitUntil][textDocument/willSaveWaitUntil]]) asynchronously.
  - =imenu= support is now handled asynchronously (Thanks to Dario Gjorgjevski).
  - Added option =:none= for =lsp-prefer-flymake=, which disabled both Flymake and
    Flycheck support.
  - Changed =flymake= to report the errors immediately after they arrive instead
    of waiting =flymake= to call =lsp-mode=.
  - Add debounce when server does not support incremental updates.
  - Add hook =lsp-after-uninitialized-hook=, which stores the list of functions
    called after a language server has been uninitialized.
  - Add variable =lsp-symbol-highlighting-skip-current=, which lets the user skip
    the current symbol when a given symbol is being highlighted.
  - Add variable =lsp-enabled-clients=, which lets users set which defined clients
    are allowed to be used.
  - Support multiple signatures while displaying eldoc text. Add variable
    =lsp-signature-render-all=, which when non-nil forces =lsp-mode= to only show
    the current active signature.
  - Expose configuration settings for various language servers.
  - Language servers can now be disabled with the variable =lsp-disabled-clients=.
  - Improved applying changes speed.
  - Fixed =xref= support for emacs 27+

  - Added Emacs 26.x to CI
  - Fixed handling of stderr when running over =TRAMP=.

** Release 6.0
  - ~lsp-mode~ now have single entry point ~lsp~ for all language and based on the major mode starts the corresponding language servers.
  - Added ~flymake~ integration.
  - ~lsp~ automatically enables and configures ~company-lsp~, ~lsp-ui~, ~yasnippet~, or ~flymake~ if they are present so no additional configuration is needed except installing the packages. That behavior could be disabled by setting ~lsp-auto-configure~ to ~nil~.
  - ~lsp-mode~ ships with several predefined servers located in ~lsp-clients.el~ which does not require additional package. For the more complex Language Servers like ~Eclipse JDT~, ~ccls~, ~cquery~ and ~haskell~ we still require separate package due to relatively high code base.
  - ~lsp-mode~ handles automatically server failures by asking the user whether he/she wants to restart the server.
  - introduced new command ~lsp-describe-session~ which replaces the existing one ~lsp-capabilities~. The command lists the folders that are part of the workspace and the servers that are associated with the corresponding folder.
  - ~lsp-mode~ displays information about the running server and it's status in the modeline.
  - ~lsp-define-stdio-client~ and ~lsp-define-tcp-client~ are replaced with ~lsp-register-client~
  - ~lsp~ rely on ~projectile~ or ~project.el~ now only for suggesting project root. Once you open new file in a project and start ~lsp~ it will provide several options(import project, blacklist project, select other directory root). Once you select a root it will be persisted and used for the next sessions.
  - support for multiple language servers per single file and workspace.
  - changed ~lsp-mode~ settings to more sensible defaults.
  - Removed all synchronous calls from the server startup.
  - Improved multi-folder support.
  - added backends for: Bash, C++, CSS, Dart, Elixir, Fortran, Go, Groovy, HTML, Javascript/Typescript, Javascript/Typescript, Ocaml, PHP, Python, Ruby, Rust, Vue, Flow
