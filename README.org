** Overview
   Client for [[https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/][Language Server Protocol]] (v3.14). [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][lsp-mode]] aims to provide IDE-like experience by providing optional integration with the most popular Emacs packages like ~company~, ~flycheck~ and ~projectile~.
   - Non-blocking asynchronous calls
   - Real-time Diagnostics/linting via [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck][flycheck]] (recommended) or ~flymake~ when Emacs > 26 (requires flymake>=1.0.5)
   - Code completion - ~completion-at-point~ or external
     [[https://github.com/tigersoldier/company-lsp][company-lsp]] (note that [[https://github.com/tigersoldier/company-lsp][company-lsp]] is no longer supported and it is recommended to use builtin ~company-capf~). If you want
     to use experimental ~company-capf~ integration you may force it by setting
     ~company-capf~ to ~t~.
   - Hovers - using [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-ui][lsp-ui]]
   - Code actions - using ~lsp-execute-code-action~ or [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-ui][lsp-ui]] sideline.
   - Code outline - using builtin [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Imenu.html][imenu]] or ~helm-imenu~
   - Code navigation - using builtin [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Xref.html][xref]], [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-treemacs][lsp-treemacs]] tree views or [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-ui][lsp-ui]] peek functions.
   - Code lens
   - Symbol highlights
   - Formatting

** Installation
*** Install via melpa
    The recommended way to install ~lsp-mode~ is via ~package.el~ - the built-in package manager in Emacs. ~lsp-mode~ is available on the two major ~package.el~ community maintained repos - [[http://stable.melpa.org][MELPA Stable]] and [[http://melpa.org][MELPA]].

    M-x ~package-install~ [RET] ~lsp-mode~ [RET]
** Configuration
*** Install language server
    Check the table below with the list of supported servers and the corresponding instructions on how to install the server.
*** Configure lsp-mode
**** Vanilla Emacs
     You could go minimal and use ~lsp-mode~ as it is without external packages with the built-in ~flymake~ and ~completion-at-point~ or you could install the following extensions for better experience:
     - install [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-ui][lsp-ui]] for fancy sideline, popup documentation, VScode-like peek UI, etc.
     - install [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck][flycheck]] if you prefer the more popular ~flycheck~ over renewed ~flymake~. ~lsp-mode~ will automatically pick it up.
     - install [[https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode][company-mode]] for completion popups.
     - install [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-treemacs][lsp-treemacs]] for various three based UI controls (symbols, errors overview, call hierarchy, etc.)
     - install [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/helm-lsp][helm-lsp]] provides on type completion afternative of =xref-apropos= using =helm=.
     - install [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-ivy][lsp-ivy]] provides on type completion afternative of =xref-apropos= using =ivy=.
     - install [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/dap-mode][dap-mode]] if your language is supported by the debugger.
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       ;; if you want to change prefix for lsp-mode keybindings.
       (setq lsp-keymap-prefix "s-l")

       (require 'lsp-mode)
       (add-hook 'XXX-mode-hook #'lsp)
     #+END_SRC
     where ~XXX~ could be major mode like ~python~, ~java~, ~c++~. Alternatively, if you want to minimize you configuration you may use ~prog-mode-hook~. In case you do that, ~lsp~ will try to start for each programming mode and echo a message when there is no client registered for the current mode or if the corresponding server is not present. In addition, ~lsp-mode~ will automatically detect and configure [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-ui][lsp-ui]] and [[https://github.com/tigersoldier/company-lsp][company-lsp]]. To turn off that behavior you could set ~lsp-auto-configure~ to ~nil~.

     To defer LSP server startup (and DidOpen notifications) until the buffer is visible you can use ~lsp-deferred~ instead of ~lsp~:
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (add-hook 'XXX-mode-hook #'lsp-deferred)
     #+END_SRC
**** Spacemacs
     [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode][lsp-mode]] is included in spacemacs develop branch. Add ~lsp~ to ~dotspacemacs-configuration-layers~ and configure the language that you want to use to be backed by ~lsp~ backend.
**** use-package
     Replace ~(require 'lsp-mode)~ with the following if you use use-package.
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       ;; set prefix for lsp-command-keymap (few alternatives - "C-l", "C-c l")
       (setq lsp-keymap-prefix "s-l")

       (use-package lsp-mode
         :hook (;; replace XXX-mode with concrete major-mode(e. g. python-mode)
                (XXX-mode . lsp)
                ;; if you want which-key integration
                (lsp-mode . lsp-enable-which-key-integration))
         :commands lsp)

       ;; optionally
       (use-package lsp-ui :commands lsp-ui-mode)
       ;; if you are helm user
       (use-package helm-lsp :commands helm-lsp-workspace-symbol)
       ;; if you are ivy user
       (use-package lsp-ivy :commands lsp-ivy-workspace-symbol)
       (use-package lsp-treemacs :commands lsp-treemacs-errors-list)

       ;; optionally if you want to use debugger
       (use-package dap-mode)
       ;; (use-package dap-LANGUAGE) to load the dap adapter for your language

       ;; optional if you want which-key integration
       (use-package which-key
         :config
         (which-key-mode))

     #+END_SRC

     To defer LSP server startup (and DidOpen notifications) until the buffer is visible you can use ~lsp-deferred~ instead of ~lsp~:
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (use-package lsp-mode
         :hook (XXX-mode . lsp-deferred)
         :commands (lsp lsp-deferred))
     #+END_SRC
**** Recommended settings for lsp-mode related packages
***** company
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
             (setq company-minimum-prefix-length 1
                   company-idle-delay 0.0) ;; default is 0.2
     #+END_SRC
**** Formatting
     In general the formatter settings are language server specific(e. g. =JDT
     LS= uses eclipse formatter file and =lsp-java-format-settings-url= to
     configure it while clangd uses =clangd-format=). The only settings that are
     controlled on =lsp-mode= level are indent size and whether the server
     should use tabs or spaces.
       - Use =c-basic-offset= for =cc-mode= derived moves(e. g. java, C++) to
         control the tab size.
       - Use =tab-width= for any other mode to do the same.
       - Use =indent-tabs-mode= for sellecting tab/spaces.
**** Docker
     Refer to [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-docker/][lsp-docker]] README which provide a guide how you can run =lsp-mode= in =docker= container.
*** Performance
    When configured properly =lsp-mode='s performance is on par with mainstream
    LSP clients (e. g. =VScode=, =Theia=, etc). Here are steps to achieve
    optimal results.
    - Use Emacs 27+ with native json support. In order to validate that you
      match this criteria do =M-: (functionp 'json-serialize) RET=. Benchmarks
      show that Emacs 27 is =~15 times= faster than Emacs when using Elisp json
      parser implementation.
    - Adjust =gc-cons-threshold=. The default setting is too low for
      =lsp-mode='s needs due to the fact that client/server communication
      generates a lot of memory/garbage. You have two options:
      - Set it to big number(100mb) like most of the popular starter kits like
        Spacemacs/Doom/Prelude, etc do:
      #+BEGIN_SRC elisp
        (setq gc-cons-threshold 100000000)
      #+END_SRC
      - Follow the method recommended by Gnu Emacs Maintainer Eli Zaretskii:
        "My suggestion is to repeatedly multiply gc-cons-threshold by 2 until
        you stop seeing significant improvements in responsiveness, and in any
        case not to increase by a factor larger than 100 or somesuch. If even a
        100-fold increase doesn't help, there's some deeper problem with the
        Lisp code which produces so much garbage, or maybe GC is not the reason
        for slowdown."
        Source: https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/brc05y/is_lspmode_too_slow_to_use_for_anyone_else/eofulix/
    - Increase the amount of data which Emacs reads from the process. Again the
      emacs default is too low 4k considering that the some of the language
      server responses are in 800k - 3M range.
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (setq read-process-output-max (* 1024 1024)) ;; 1mb
    #+END_SRC
    - Optional: use =company-capf= . Although =company-lsp= also supports
      caching =lsp-mode='s =company-capf= does that by default. To achieve that
      uninstall =company-lsp= or put these lines in your config:
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (setq lsp-prefer-capf t)
    #+END_SRC
      /Note:/ - to verify which =company= backend implementation you are using
      do =M-x company-diag= when performing auto-completion.
    - Optional: Disable =lsp-ui=. Normally, =lsp-ui= is very fast but in some
      systems (especially when using =Windows=) =lsp-ui= overlays and popups might
      slow down emacs.
    - Optional: fine-tune =lsp-idle-delay=. This variable determines how often
      lsp-mode will refresh the highlights, lenses, links, etc while you type.
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (setq lsp-idle-delay 0.500)
    #+END_SRC
**** Reporting performance problems
     If you have tried all of the non-optional steps from the list and =emacs= is
     still not very responsive please open a PR with the following information:
     - Collect *lsp-log* data after setting =lsp-print-performance= to =t=.
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (setq lsp-print-performance t)
     #+END_SRC
     - Include emacs performance report. Use the following step to collect it:
       - =M-x profiler-start= and select =CPU=
       - Reproduce the slow behavior.
       - =M-x profiler-stop=
       - In the profiler report expand all nodes by doing =C-u TAB=.
      /Note:/ - =lsp-mode= is just a frontend and the performance depends on
      server as well. Some servers (e. g. Palantir's Python Language Server)
      might be slow when performing auto-completion.
*** How does it work?
    ~lsp-mode~ has predefined list of server configurations (loaded in ~lsp-clients.el~) containing a mapping from ~major-mode~ to the server configuration or by using activation function. In addition to the default server configuration located in ~lsp-clients.el~ there are few languages servers which require separate package(check [[#supported-languages][Supported languages]]). When you open a file from a particular project ~lsp-mode~ and call ~lsp~ command ~lsp-mode~ will look for server registrations able to handle current file. If there is such client ~lsp-mode~ will look for the project root. If you open a file from the project for the first time you will be prompted to define the current project root. Once the project root is selected it is saved in ~lsp-session~ file and it will be loaded the next time you start Emacs so you no longer will be asked for a project root when you open a file from that project. Later if you want to change the project root you may use ~lsp-workspace-folder-remove~ to remove the project and call ~lsp-workspace-folder-add~ to add the root. If you want to force starting a particular language server in a file you may use ~C-u~ ~M-x~ ~lsp~ which will prompt you to select language server to start.
** Supported languages
   Some of the servers are directly supported by ~lsp-mode~ by requiring
   ~lsp-clients.el~ while others require installing additional packages which provide
   server specific functionality.

** Commands
   When using ~lsp-mode~ most of the features depend on server capabilities.
   ~lsp-mode~ provides default bindings which are dynamically enabled/disabled
   based on the server functionality. All the commands are configured
   ~lsp-command-map~ which is bound to ~lsp-keymap-prefix~ (default ~s-l~).

*** which-key integration
    To enable [[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key/][which-key]] integration in the active major mode for ~lsp-mode-map~
    you will need to call the ~lsp-enable-which-key-integration~ function. This
    could be done when ~lsp-mode~ starts with the following:

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (with-eval-after-load 'lsp-mode
         (add-hook 'lsp-mode-hook #'lsp-enable-which-key-integration))
     #+END_SRC

     You can also enable which-key integration for all major modes by passing ~t~
     as a parameter. This is useful for buffers that can use multiple major modes
     like those using ~vue-mode~.

  [[file:examples/which-key.png]]
*** Modeline errors
    To see all error statistics in the modeline you can enable
    ~lsp-diagnostics-modeline-mode~. This is especially useful for languages
    that compilation might be broken due to errors in other files(e. g. Java/Haskell).
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (with-eval-after-load 'lsp-mode
         ;; :project/:workspace/:file
         (setq lsp-diagnostics-modeline-scope :project)
         (add-hook 'lsp-managed-mode-hook 'lsp-diagnostics-modeline-mode))
     #+END_SRC
     /Tip:/ To find out the global errors you might use ~lsp-treemacs-errors-list~.
** Settings

** Extensions
*** TRAMP
    LSP mode has support for tramp buffers with the following requirements:
    - The language server has to be present on the remote server.
    - Having multi folder language server (like [[https://github.com/eclipse/eclipse.jdt.ls][Eclipse JDT LS]]) cannot have local and remote workspace folders.
**** How does it work?
     ~lsp-mode~ detects whether a particular file is located on remote machine and looks for a client which matches current file and it is marked as ~:remote?~ t. Then ~lsp-mode~ starts the client through tramp.
**** Sample configuration
     Here it is example how you can configure python language server to work when using ~TRAMP~. Note that if you are trying to convert existing language server configuration you should copy all of it's properties(e. g. ~:request-handlers~, ~activation-fn~, etc).
     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
       (lsp-register-client
        (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-tramp-connection "<insert your LS's binary name or path here>")
                         :major-modes '(python-mode)
                         :remote? t
                         :server-id 'pyls-remote))
     #+END_SRC
**** Dealing with stderr
     With TRAMP, Emacs does not have an easy way to distinguish stdout and stderr, so when the underlying LSP process writes to stderr, it breaks the ~lsp-mode~ parser. As a workaround, ~lsp-mode~ is redirecting stderr to ~/tmp/<process-name>-<id>~stderr~.
** Limitations
*** File watches
    When some of the workspaces that are active in the current project requests file notifications via ~workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles~ ~lsp-mode~ will start monitoring each of the folders in the workspace for changes. In case your project contains a lot of files you might want to disable file monitoring via ~lsp-enable-file-watchers~ (you may use dir-locals).
** Contributions
   Contributions are very much welcome.

** Troubleshooting
   - check ~*lsp-log*~ buffer and verify that =lsp-mode= is able to find the
     server. If =lsp-mode= is unable to find the binary but it is on the path it
     is probably caused by the fact that emacs is running with different path.
     You may check the current path by executing =M-: (getenv "PATH")=. If this
     is the case, you have several options to fix the issue.
     - make sure that emacs is using the proper path by running emacs from terminal
     - Modify the path using =setpath=
     - Look for =lsp-mode= variable to customize server path. Usually, you may
       find the variable by doing =M-x customize-group RET
       lsp-LANGUAGE-SERVER-ID=.
   - set ~lsp-log-io~ to ~t~ to inspect communication between client and the server. Use =lsp-workspace-show-log= to switch to the corresponding log buffer.
   - ~lsp-describe-session~ will show the current projects roots + the started severs and allows inspecting the server capabilities.

** Adding support for languages
*** Registering server
    Here it is the minimal configuration that is needed for new language server registration. Refer to the documentation of ~lsp-client.el~ for the additional settings supported on registration time. ~lsp-language-id-configuration~ must be updated to contain the corresponding mode -> language id - in this case ~(python-mode . "python")~
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (defvar lsp-language-id-configuration
        '(...
          (python-mode . "python")
          ...))
      ;; if you are adding the support for your language server in separate repo use
      ;; (add-to-list 'lsp-language-id-configuration '(python-mode . "python"))

      (lsp-register-client
       (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection "pyls")
                        :major-modes '(python-mode)
                        :server-id 'pyls))
    #+END_SRC

    If the language server supports environment variables to control additional behavior, you can register that by using the ~:environment-fn~ function, like the Bash language client does:

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (lsp-register-client
       (make-lsp-client :new-connection (lsp-stdio-connection '("bash-language-server" "start"))
                        :major-modes '(sh-mode)
                        :priority -1
                        :environment-fn (lambda ()
                                          (("EXPLAINSHELL_ENDPOINT" . lsp-bash-explainshell-endpoint)
                                           ("HIGHLIGHT_PARSING_ERRORS" . lsp-bash-highlight-parsing-errors)))
                        :server-id 'bash-ls))
    #+END_SRC

    ~lsp-bash-explainshell-endpoint~ and ~lsp-bash-highlight-parsing-errors~ are language client ~defcustom~ that expose supported server environment settings in a type-safe way. If you change any of those variables, restart the language server with ~lsp-restart-workspace~ for the changes to be applied.

*** Sections
    ~lsp-mode~ provides tools to bridge emacs ~defcustom~ as a language configuration sections properties(see [[https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specification#workspace_configuration][specification workspace/configuration]]). In addition you may use ~lsp-generate-settings~ from [[https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/blob/master/scripts/lsp-generate-settings.el][Generate Settings script]] to generate ~defcustom~ from ~package.json~ VScode plugin manifest. Example:
    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
      (defcustom lsp-foo-language-server-property "bar"
        "Demo property."
        :group 'foo-ls
        :risky t)

      (lsp-register-custom-settings '(("foo.section.property" lsp-foo-language-server-property)))

      (lsp-configuration-section  "foo")
      ;; =>  (("foo" ("settings" ("property" . "bar"))))
    #+END_SRC
** FAQ
   - How do I troubleshoot "Server FOO-LS:pid exited with status signal. Do you want to restart it? (y or n)"?
     - This message indicates that the language server has crashed for some
       reason. You may check the server stderr which is =*FOO-LS::stderr*=. If
       you get this message on startup you may try to run the exact command that
       =lsp-mode= is running in the terminal. You may find it in =*lsp-log*=
       buffer.
   - How to configure a server with local variables?
     - Add ~lsp~ server call to ~hack-local-variables-hook~ which runs right after the local variables are loaded.
       #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
         (add-hook 'hack-local-variables-hook
                   (lambda () (when (derived-mode-p 'XXX-mode) (lsp))))
       #+END_SRC
   - I have multiple language servers registered for language FOO. Which one will be used when opening a project?
     - The one with highest priority wins. ~lsp-clients.el~ predefined servers have
       priority -1, lower than external packages (priority 0 if unspecified). If a
       server is registered with ~:add-on?~ flag set to ~t~ it will be started in
       parallel to the other servers that are registered for the current mode.
   - I have multiple language servers for language =FOO= and I want to select the server per project, what can I do?
     - You may create =dir-local= for each of the projects and specify list of
       =lsp-enabled-clients=. This will narrow the list of the clients that are
       going to be tested for the project.
   - The completion does not work fine and inserts arguments and placeholders, what I am doing wrong?
     - Snippet support works only with =company-lsp= so if you are using
       =completion-at-point= the snippets won't be expanded and you should
       either disable them by setting =lsp-enable-snippet= to =nil= or you
       should switch to =company-lsp=. Note also that =company-tng= frontend
       does not support snippet expansion(see [[https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode/issues/891][company-mode#891]])
   - I am getting "Package ‘spinner-1.7.3’ is unavailable" when trying to install =lsp-mode=.
     - This is caused by GPG keys used by the ELPA package manager not being up
       to date. You may fix by installing: [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/gnu-elpa-keyring-update.html][gnu-elpa-keyring-update]]
   - The flycheck does not work in =typescript=, =html= and =javascript= blocks in =vue-mode=. How to fix that?
     - This is caused by the fact that =vue-mode= uses multiple major modes in
       single file and the =lsp-ui= checker may not associated with the major mode
       at point. You could fix that by adding the following lines to your config.
       #+begin_src elisp
         (with-eval-after-load 'lsp-mode
           (mapc #'lsp-flycheck-add-mode '(typescript-mode js-mode css-mode vue-html-mode)))
       #+end_src
   - I have disabled snippets and ~Rust Analyzer~ server inserts redundant ~$0~ when performing completion?
     - ~Rust Analyzer~ does not support disabling snippets - see https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues/2518
